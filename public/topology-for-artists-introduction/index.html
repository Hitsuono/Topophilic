<h1 id="what-youll-need">What you&rsquo;ll need</h1>
<p>Short answer: <strong>basic set theory</strong> (cartesian product, injective, surjective and bijective functions, cardinality) and <strong>introductory linear algebra</strong> (you can find a quick reminder on the post concerning algebra).</p>
<p>I tried to write these posts as accessible as possible, but without losing much of the mathematical rigour. Mathematics is a human endeavour of unlimited aesthetic capacity, but this comes with a cost&ndash; namely, rigour and precision. It is beautiful because so much formality can&rsquo;t be in vain. Without this limitation, there can ultimately be no beauty; the first is simultaneously the latter&rsquo;s restriction and its progenitor. Or, rather, rigour and aesthetical creativity are <em>consubstantial</em> in mathematics. The other member of this trinity is the insatiable human desire to further mathematicize the world and recognize itself in this construction&ndash; to spread the Word and be in a Body, so to speak. But let&rsquo;s leave the formal-hegelian-christian analogies for another place for now.</p>
<p>Fact is, leaving out the more difficult and rigorous parts <strong>is</strong> necessary when writing to a larger audience, but I tried to keep some balance&ndash; particularly without insulting the intelligence and interest of the reader. You can always skip the more technical sections, and I hope they can spark out your curiosity and be more accessible when you come back to them.</p>
<p>Here are some extra I remind the reader of some other basic concepts of set theory.</p>
<p>A basic understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality">cardinality</a> is (all you&rsquo;ll need to know is the difference between countable and uncountable sets and that $\ro$ is uncountable).</p>
<p>A <strong>strict order</strong> on a set $X$ is a (binary) relation between elements of $X$ such that</p>
<ul>
<li>Not $a< a$;</li>
<li>If $a< b$ then not $b> a$;</li>
<li>If $a< b$ and $b< c,$ then $a< c$;</li>
<li>If $a\neq b,$ then $a< b$ or $b < a$ (this is the &ldquo;totality&rdquo; of the order).</li>
</ul>
<p>When every two distinct elements $a,b\in X$ can be compared by an order (i.e., $a< b$ or $a>b$), the order is said to be <strong>total</strong>; else it is a <strong>partial</strong> order. The set $X$ together with some total/partial strict order is said to be a totally/partially ordered set.</p>
<p>An <strong>equivalence relation</strong> on a set $X$ is a (binary) relation between elements of $X$ such that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reflexivity: $a\sim a;$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Symmetry: $a\sim b$ implies $b\sim a;$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transitivity: $a\sim b$ and $b\sim c$ imply $a \sim c.$</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With an equivalence relation, you can define its <strong>equivalence classes</strong>, which are the sets</p>
$$[x]=\{y\in X\mid x\sim y\},$$<p>or, equivalently, the maximal subsets of $X$ containing only equivalent elements. The set of equivalence classes based on the relation $\sim$ in $X$ is denoted $X/\sim.$ That is,</p>
$$X/\sim = \{[x]\mid x\in X\}$$<p>A function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ can be extended to a $f':X/\sim \rightarrow Y$ if $f(x)=f(y)$ for all $x\sim y,$ simply defining $f'([x])=f(x),$ in which case we use the jargon that $f'$ is <strong>well-defined</strong>. A function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ can always be extended to a $f':X\rightarrow Y/\sim$ by setting $f'(x)=[x].$</p>
<h1 id="metric-spaces">Metric spaces</h1>
<h2 id="abstract-distances">Abstract distances</h2>
<p>The most natural notion of an abstract space is that of a set together with some kind of &ldquo;distance&rdquo; between its points. These are called metric spaces and will properly be defined after some examples.</p>
<p>For example, in $\ro^n$ we can always define the <strong>Euclidean distance</strong> $d(x,y)=\sqrt{(x_1-y_1)^2+...+(x_n-y_n)^2}$ between points $x=(x_1,...,x_n)$ and $y=(y_1,...,y_n)$&ndash; you can read more on it in the first section of the post concerning algebra, dedicated to linear algebra. This is the normal, flat distance we use in the real-world, but it isn&rsquo;t the only mathematical option available. Another one we implicitly use in our day-to-day is the <strong>Manhattan distance</strong>, in which we consider only the difference between coordinate components and sum them up: $d(x,y)=|x_1-y_1|+...+ |x_n-y_n|.$ The name is illustrative: if you&rsquo;re walking in a rectangular grid of streets (like in Manhattan), the physical distance between you and your destination is irrelevant, since you can&rsquo;t walk through the buildings; the real distance you&rsquo;re going to travel only takes into account the straight line distances in the grid, and for that you use the Manhattan distance.</p>
<p>IMG!!! Manhattan</p>
<p>The Manhattan distance is widely used in any application where you work with a rectangular grid, for example when programming board games.</p>
<p>The Manhattan distance shares a similarity with the Euclidean one: both involve sums over differences of coordinates. This motivates us to define the so-called $\mathcal{l}^p$ <strong>distances</strong> in $\ro^n,$ defined as</p>
$$d(x,y)=\left(|x_1-y_1|^p+...+|x_n-y_n|^p\right)^{1/p}.$$<p>As you can see, setting $p=1$ gives us the Manhattan distance, and $p=2$ the Euclidean one. The cases $p>2$ are mathematically interesting, but we won&rsquo;t really consider them in this series.</p>
<p>Graphs
Another context where applying a notion of distance to a set is quite natural comes when dealing with <strong>graphs</strong>. A graph is a pair $G=(V,E)$ of a generic set $V$&ndash; called the set of vertices, even though the elements of $V$ don&rsquo;t need to be points in space but anything you want&ndash; and $E$ is a set of pairs $(v_1,v_2)$ of elements of $V.$ We usually think of the $v$ inside of $V$ as points in space and the $e=(v_1,v_2)$ in $E$ as straight edges connecting points $v_1$ and $v_2$. These edges may or may not be directed: we&rsquo;ll think of them as undirected here.</p>
<p>IMG!!! GRAFOS</p>
<p>Ignoring any possible geometry behind our set $V$, we can define a distancee between vertices considering only the edge structure on the graph: just define $d(v_1,v_2)$ to be the minimal amount of edges you need to transverse to go from $v_1$ to $v_2.$ This amounts to interpreting all edges to correspond to a path of distance 1. This distance is implicilty used in basically any practical problem involving graphs.</p>
<p>Another distance that may be so obvious to us day-to-day that we even forget to mention it is the so-called <strong>Hamming distance</strong>. If you have two strings of symbols of the same length, this is the distance you naturally use to measure how different they are: you just count the amount of times these strings differ per-position. For example, the strings &ldquo;Topophilic&rdquo; and &ldquo;臻9opophilic&rdquo; have distance two because they differ in two positions. More formally, if we have an alphabet set $\mathcal{A}$ of symbols, then a string of length $n$ is the same as an element of $\mathcal{A}^n.$ These strings may be represented as $x=x_0x_1...x_n,$ each $x_i$ a symbol in $\mathcal{A},$ so that the Hamming distance in $\mathcal{A}^n$ is</p>
$$d(x,y)=\text{amount of positions } i \text{ where }x_i\neq y_i.$$<p>We&rsquo;ll later on extend the Hamming distance to infinite strings and apply it to the set of possible configurations of cells in a cellular automata grid, paving the way for a fascinating application of topology.</p>
<p>Finally, we can also define <strong>distances between functions</strong>. Specifically, call $C([0,1])$ the set of all continuous functions between $[0,1]$ and $\ro.$ We&rsquo;ll explain later exactly what a continuous function is: for the momment, just take these as all the graphs that can be drawn without taking up your pencil from the paper, forming a continuous line. Then we can define the are between functions $f$ and $g$ as their distance&ndash; using calculus,</p>
$$d(f,g)=\int_0^1 |f(x)-g(x)|dx$$<p>IMG!!! L1</p>
<p>You can see this is somewhat similar to the $\mathcal{l}^1$ (Manhattan) distance defined above; because of this, it is also called the $L^1$ distance between functions $f$ and $g$. Similarly, one might define the general $L^p$ <strong>distance</strong> of functions as</p>
$$d(f,g)=\left(\int_0^1 |f(x)-g(x)|^p dx\right)^{1/p}$$<p>There&rsquo;s also the $L^\infty$ distance, defined as the maximum distance that they can take for the same input $x$: i.e., it is the distance $d(f,g)=\max\{|f(x)-g(x)|\mid x\in [0,1]\}.$</p>
<h2 id="metric-spaces-1">Metric spaces</h2>
<p>After all these examples of &ldquo;distances&rdquo; on sets, it&rsquo;s natural to look for similarities between these examples to get a general definition. It isn&rsquo;t too far-fetched to propose one like this:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a <strong>metric space</strong> is a set $X$ with a function $d:X\times X\rightarrow \ro$ that takes two elements $x,y$ of $X$ and returns a real number $d(x,y)$ representing their distance. This $d$ must the following properties to be a sensible representation of distance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Non-negative: $d(x,y)\geq 0$ for all $x,y$ in $X$;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distance of $x$ to itself must be zero: $d(x,x)=0$ for all $x$;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It mus be symmetrical: $d(x,y)=d(y,x)$ for all $x,y$;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It must satisfy the <em>triangular inequality</em>: $d(x,y)+d(x,z)\leq d(y,z)$ for all $x,y,z.$</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the only property that deserves further comment is the last one. Imagine $x,y,z$ are points in the plane forming a triangle. Breaking the triangular inequality would mean that there is one edge larger than the sum of the two other ones. This seems pretty absurd and would render the theory quite uninteresting and un-geometric later on.</p>
<p>IMG!!! TRIANGULAR INEQ</p>
<p>The function $d$ above is commonly called a <strong>metric</strong> on $X.$ You can check all the examples we gave in the previous sections are indeed valid metrics.</p>
<h2 id="metric-sets">Metric sets</h2>
<p>So far, we&rsquo;ve been strictly in the world of geometry, as we still pretty much care about distances. <strong>This section is the heart of the transition from metric to topological spaces.</strong></p>
<p>One interesting way to study metric spaces is by sets naturally defined using the metric. For example, if we have a point $x\in X,$ we can always consider the set of points within a certain radius $r>0$ of $x$&ndash; mathematically, the set</p>
$$B(x,r)=\{y\in X\mid d(x,y)< r\},$$<p>called the <strong>open ball</strong> of radius $r$ centered on $x$ (even though it might not look like a ball or a disk at all). Notice that points $y$ at distance exactly $r$ are not inside this; to add them, we consider the <strong>closed ball</strong></p>
$$\bar{B}(x,r)=\{y\in X\mid d(x,y)\leq r\}.$$<p>It&rsquo;s also natural to consider those points only at distance $r$ from $x$ (like a circle), getting the <strong>boundary of the ball</strong>, denoted $\partial B(x,r),$ which is simply $\bar{B}(x,r)\setminus B(x,r)$&ndash; or, equivalently,</p>
$$\partial B(x,r)=\{y\in X\mid d(x,y)=r\}.$$<p>Note that a closed ball is exactly the open one plus a boundary, a frontier set.</p>
<p>Here is a collection of balls in different metrics for $\rt$:</p>
<p>IMGS!!! BALLS</p>
<p>Open balls have some interesting set-theoretic properties. First, note that $X$ is <strong>covered</strong> by them: i.e., for all $x\in X,$ there is an open ball containing it ($B(x,1)$, for example). They also have the property that their interesctions are &ldquo;fat&rdquo; and contain balls themselves: i.e., if $z\in X$ is in the intersection of balls $B(x,r_1)$ and $B(y,r_2),$ then there&rsquo;s some radius $r$ such that the ball $B(z,r)$ is inside the intersection:</p>
$$B(z,r)\subseteq B(x,r_1)\cap B(y,r_2).$$<p>For that, just take any $r$ smaller than $d(x,y)-\max\{d(x,z), d(y,z)\}$ (this is posivite by the triangular inequality), as in the image below.</p>
<p>IMG!!! FAT BALLS</p>
<p>This &ldquo;fat&rdquo; property is very important: it tells you that no point in the intersection of open balls is a boundary point, since they always have a ball around them inside the intersection itself. This &ldquo;fatness&rdquo;  is more formally called <strong>openness</strong>, and we say a subset $S\subseteq X$ is open if for all $x\in S,$ there&rsquo;s some $r$ such that $B(x,r)\subseteq X.$ Visually, these are fat set with no boundary/frontier points.</p>
<p>Set-theoretically, open sets are somewhat well-behaved in respect to unions and intersections. Indeed, any union (including infinite ones) of open sets will still be open, since the open balls containing elements will still be inside the union. With respect to intersection, finite intersections of open sets are open as well: for if $U$ and $V$ are open and $x\in U\cap V,$ then, by the definition of openess, there are $r_1,r_2$ such that $B(x,r_1)\subseteq U$ and $B(x,r_2)\subseteq V,$ so that $B(x,\min \{r_1,r_2\})\subseteq U\cap V$ and the intersection is open.</p>
<p>This is valid only for finite intersections: for example, if you do the infinite intersection $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty B(x,1/n)$ of smaller and smaller open balls around $x$ is exactly the set $\{x\}$ containing only the point $x$ itself. In $\ro,$ points aren&rsquo;t open, however, since this would imply the existence of a ball $B(x,r)$ lying inside $\{x\}$&ndash; i.e., imply $B(x,r)=\{x\},$ thus $r=0,$ something we don&rsquo;t allow as counting as open balls.</p>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been thinking quite informally of open sets as &ldquo;balls&rdquo;, or &ldquo;disks&rdquo;, because that&rsquo;s how they look in $\ro^n.$ But let&rsquo;s consider a different space: take a graph $G$ and metricize it with the metric we described. Then for a vertex $v\in G,$ the open ball $B(v,r)$ is the set of all vertices within less than $r$ edges of $v.$ Since $B(v,r)$ for $r<1$ is simply $v$ itself, we get that every vertex in $G$ is open&ndash; and, since countable unions of open sets are open, any set of vertices of $G$ is open.</p>
<p>A less trivial example is given by $C([0,1])$ with the $L^\infty$ metric. Here, the open ball $B(f, r),$ for some $f\in C([0,1]),$ is the set of all (continuous) functions that differ from $f$ less than $r$ in every point. There are infinitely many of these, with all possible shapes.</p>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>In this space, for example, the set $U=\{f\in C([0,1])\mid f(x)\neq 0\text{, for all } x\in[0,1]\}$ is open. This is the case because, if $g\in U$ and $r$ is the closest $g$ gets to $0,$ then $B(g,r)\subseteq U$ (actually proving this requires the proper treatment of continuity we&rsquo;ll give in the next section).</p>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>These examples should show that, in metric spaces, <strong>by definition a subset</strong> $U$ <strong>is open if, for every</strong> $x$ <strong>in</strong> $U,$ <strong>a small perturbation of</strong> $x$ <strong>(measured with the metric) remains inside</strong> $U.$ This is starting to smell like the &ldquo;continuous deformations&rdquo; we mentioned informally in the introduction. All we need now is to define continuity properly, and we&rsquo;ll finally get into topology proper.</p>
<h2 id="continuity">Continuity</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve taken a Calculus I course, you&rsquo;ll surely have met the definition of a real continuous functions; if you haven&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t worry! Visually, a function $f:\ro\rightarrow \ro$ is said to be continuous if its graph has no sudden jumps&ndash; if it can be drawn continuously without taking your pen from the paper. More formally, this means that if a sequence of points sequence of points $x_1,x_2,...$ gets closer and closer&ndash; converges, we say&ndash; to a point $a\in \ro$ in the $x$ axis, then the sequence $f(x_1),f(x_2),...$ will also converge to $f(a)$. We often write sequences as $\{x_n\}$ and, if it converges to a point $a$ when $n$ gets larger, that $a$ is its <strong>limit</strong>, writing $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}x_n=a.$ Informally using this limit notation, a function $f$ as above is continuous if, and only if,</p>
$$\lim_{x\rightarrow a}f(x)=f(a).$$<p>IMG!!! func contínua e descontínua</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how to make formal sense of these terms and notations.</p>
<p>More properly, we say an infinite sequence $\{x_n\}$ converges to a value $a$ whenever for any positive real number $\epsilon>0$ (which can be very, very small), there&rsquo;s some index $N$ such that $d(x_n, a)<\epsilon$ for all indices $n>N$. That is, you can pick an arbitrarily tiny number $\epsilon$ and there&rsquo;ll come a moment in the sequence where all points will be closer to $x_n$ as $\epsilon,$ starting from the index $N.$ You can imagine this like a game: one player proposes a challenge with a very small $\epsilon,$ and the other has to find an $N$ after which $d(x_n,a)<\epsilon.$ We then write $x_n\rightarrow a,$ or $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x_n=a.$</p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;ll only work with infinite sequences here, indexed by $n\in \mathbb{N},$ possibly containing (even infinitely many) repetitions.</strong></p>
<p>In Calculus I this is thought only inside $\ro,$ but notice that the only thing we needed here is a metric: indeed, this can be taken as the definition of convergence for any metric space $(X,d)$!</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: an infinite sequence $\{x_n\}$ in a metric space $(X,d)$ is said to <strong>converge</strong> to a point $a\in X$, written $x_n\rightarrow a,$ whenever for any positive real number $\epsilon>0,$ there is some $N$ such that $d(x_n, a)<\epsilon,$ for all $n>N.$</p>
<p>IMG!!! converging seq</p>
<p>Convergence of sequences is a property which strongly depends on and is relative to our base set $X.$ Consider, for example, $\ro$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ both with the Euclidean distance, and take some rational sequence $\{x_n\}$ that gets closer and closer to $\sqrt{2}$&ndash; i.e., approximating the square root of two. In the real line $\ro,$ we can say the $x_n$ converge to $\sqrt{2},$ but, since $\sqrt \notin \mathbb{Q},$ the $x_n$ <em>do not converge</em> in $\mathbb{Q}.$ Intuitively, the rationals are full of holes&ndash; representing irrational holes&ndash;, and there are many sequences that get closer and closer to these holes, but of course not converging inside the rationals per se.</p>
<p>Sequences getting &ldquo;closer and closer&rdquo; to something are called <strong>Cauchy sequences</strong>: $\{x_n\}$ is Cauchy if, for every $\epsilon>0,$ there&rsquo;s some $N$ such that, for all $n,m> N,$ $d(x_n, x_m)<\epsilon$&ndash; i.e., distance between sequence points get arbitrarily small. Metric spaces where all Cauchy sequences converge are called <strong>complete</strong>. The reals, for example, are complete, but the rationals aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In some sense, actually, one way to define the real numbers is as the <strong>completion</strong> of the rationals, by properly filling the wholes from non-convergent Cauchy sequences. You can check more on this on your own.</p>
<p>Using convergence, we can now properly define continuity:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ between metric spaces $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ is continuous if, for all sequences $x_n\rightarrow a,$ we have $f(x_n)\rightarrow f(a).$</p>
<p>Simple, right?! Sure, and it is a very helpful and common way to think of convergence, no matter in which area application. But it also has its disadvantages. Conceptually, it relies too much on the notion of sequences: but sequences really should be seen as tests for continuity&ndash; as a way of exemplifying and verifying it&ndash;, but not inherent to continuity as a phenomena itself. Formally, it requires proving two convergences: thus two $\epsilon$&rsquo;s and two $N$&rsquo;s, giving four variables to work with. Can&rsquo;t we get something simpler, conceptually and formally?</p>
<p>The following definition gets us rid of both problems: there are no sequences in it anymore, just general points in space, and only two variables ($\epsilon$ and $\delta$) for proving continuity. Proving it is equivalent to the previous one is a good exercise on metric spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a continuous function between metric spaces $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ is a function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ such that, for every real number $\epsilon>0,$ there exists some $\delta>0$ such that $y\in B(x, \delta)$ implies $f(y)\in B(f(x), \epsilon)$&ndash; that is, such that</p>
$$f(B(x, \delta))\subseteq B(f(x), \epsilon)$$<p>What this fundamentally says is that, for a continuous function $f,$ a small perturbation of $x$ leads to a small (possibly even null) perturbation of $f(x)$ as well&ndash; open sets are just the tool to describe this idea.</p>
<p>For example, take the function $f:\ro\rightarrow \ro$ which is $0$ in $(-\infty, 0]$ and $1$ in $(0,\infty).$ Choosing the point $x=0$ of discontinuity, we have that, for every $\delta> 0,$ $f(B(0, \delta))$ is the set $\{0,1\},$ thus picking $\epsilon < 1$ implies $B(f(0), \epsilon)$ doesn&rsquo;t contain $f(B(0, \delta))$&ndash; and thus $f$ is not continuous.</p>
<p>IMG!!!!</p>
<p>The definition above can actually be further simplified in a cleaner and deeper way, although seemingly distant from the notion of convergence. This is where topology will come in.</p>
<p>Indeed, $f(B(x, \delta))\subseteq B(f(x), \epsilon)$ is the same as $B(x, \delta) \subseteq \inv{f}(B(f(x), \epsilon)).$ But since this is valid for any $x,$ by definition the set $\inv{f}(B(f(x), \epsilon))$ is open in $X.$ It isn&rsquo;t a difficult exercise to prove that this is again equivalent to having $\inv{f}(V)$ open for any $V$ open in $Y.$</p>
<p>But now this last equivalent definition is free of any notion of metric or convergence! It depends only on open sets, nothing more. This more concise version of continuity ensues:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a <strong>continuous function</strong> between metric spaces $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ is a function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ such that, for all $V\subseteq Y$ open in $Y$, $\inv{f}(V)$ is open in $X.$</p>
<p>Note how clean this definition is: in a certain way, it deeply and truly captures the general nature of continuity as a visual phenomena. Ask yourself this: is continuity as a notion that should depend on a metric&ndash; on a definition of distance? Imagine you have a map and a continuous path inscribed in it. <strong>Does the scale of the map matter as to the path being continuous</strong>? Not at all. You can use kilometers, miles or roman feet, it&rsquo;ll remain a continuous path no matter what. Thus being continuous isn&rsquo;t properly a metric property, but something deeper and more subtle&ndash; i.e., &ldquo;topological&rdquo;. The definition of topology is getting very close to us.</p>
<p>All most common real functions are continuous. This includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, roots, exponentiation, logarithms and division as well. The last one doesn&rsquo;t seem though: the graph of $\frac{1}{x}$ has two distinct components, doesn&rsquo;t it? It does, but its domain is $\ro\setminus \{0\},$ so it is continuous, only with a domain that&rsquo;s already disconnected. We&rsquo;ll formalize this notion of &ldquo;connectedness&rdquo; later on.</p>
<p>Every linear transformation between <strong>finite dimensional</strong> vector spaces is continuous. You may find more over continuous real functions on textbooks on calculus.</p>
<p>Generally, the composition of continuous functions between metric spaces is continuous: if $f:X\rightarrow Y,$ $g:Y\rightarrow Z$ are both continuous and $V\subseteq Z$ is open, then $\inv{(g\circ f)}(V)=\inv{f}(\inv{g}(V)),$ which is open by hypothesis, so that $g\circ f$ is continuous too. Notice by the way how proving this is much, much easier and more obvious using the last definition instead of the previous ones that used explicit metrics.</p>
<p>For spaces of functions, each $L^p$ metric gives a different notion of convergence. With $L^\infty,$ this is called <em>uniform convergence</em>: more explicitly, a sequence $\{f_n\}$ of functions converges to $f$ uniformly if, for every $x$ in the domain, $f_n(x)\rightarrow f(x)$&ndash; i.e., if the functions converge punctually to $f$. What&rsquo;s interesting is that $L^p$ spaces allow for <em>non-continuous linear functions</em>: the derivative is one example. But we won&rsquo;t delve into that point here (we might though, but only much, much later in the series).</p>
<h1 id="topological-spaces">Topological spaces</h1>
<h2 id="purpose-and-definition">Purpose and definition</h2>
<p>The idea of topological spaces comes from trying to focus on the set-theoretic aspect of metric spaces: i.e., what if, instead of taking metrics as the primary concept defining our abstract spaces, we take open sets to be our basic objects? These would then give us <strong>a notion of proximity based only on sets</strong>, skipping the necessity of a distance function. The discussion above on continuity should make this quite reasonable: there are phenomena where openness is the main player, not distance. This includes not only continuity, but, as we&rsquo;ll see later, stuff like gluing two shapes together.</p>
<p>Thus we wish to define a notion of space based only on subsets, which we&rsquo;ll define as being &ldquo;open&rdquo;. These should have similar properties as open sets in metric spaces. The following definition is the most common for this:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a <strong>topological space</strong> is a set $X$ with a set $\tau$ of subsets of $X$ (called <strong>open sets</strong>) such that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$X$ and the empty set $\emptyset$ are in $\tau$;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unions (possibily infinite) of open sets are open: $\bigcup_i U_i\in \tau$ for $U_i\in \tau$;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finite intersections of open sets are open: $\bigcap_i^n U_i \in \tau$ for $U_i\in \tau.$</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some notation and terminology first: we&rsquo;ll often omit $\tau$ and, when the topology is understood from context, call just $X$ a topological space. An open set $U\subseteq X$ containing a point $x\in X$ is often called a <strong>neighborhood</strong> of $x$ (some authors differ on their definitions of neighborhoods, but that&rsquo;s the one I prefer). When we have open sets $\{U_i\}$ such that their union is equal to $X,$ we say they <strong>cover</strong> $X.$</p>
<p>Since continuity was a main reason to define topological spaces&ndash; and because these concepts are intrinsically and necessarily related&ndash;, here&rsquo;s how can easily generalize it:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a <strong>continuous function</strong> between topological spaces $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ is a function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ such that, for all $V\subseteq Y$ open in $Y$, $\inv{f}(V)$ is open in $X.$</p>
<p>The composition of topological continuous functions is also continuous: the proof is exactly the same we gave for metric spaces previously.</p>
<p>How do metric spaces fit in this definition? Well, if $(X,d)$ is a metric space, then we can <strong>topologize</strong> $X$ by taking as topology $\tau$ all the open sets of $(X,d),$ as previously defined.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t, however, always do the opposite: i.e., we can&rsquo;t generally define a metric $d$ from a general topological space $(X,\tau)$ such that $\tau$ is obtained as the open sets of $d.$ Those spaces that allow this are called <strong>metrizable</strong>, and the obtained topology $\tau$ is called a <strong>metric topology</strong>. That is, topological spaces are a broader category than metric ones, even though most of the spaces we&rsquo;ll study in this series will be metrizable.</p>
<h2 id="defining-a-topology-by-a-basis">Defining a topology by a basis</h2>
<p>In the context of metric spaces, we started with a metric and then got to defining open sets as those subsets $U$ that, for all points $x\in U,$ there was an open ball $B(x,r)\subseteq U$ containing $x$ and inside $U.$ This is generalized by the following theorem:</p>
<p><strong>Proposition</strong>: if $(X,\tau)$ is a topological space and $U\subseteq X$ is a subset such that, for all $x\in U,$ there&rsquo;s an open set $V(x)\subseteq U$ containing $x$ and inside $U,$ then $U$ is open.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>: taking all such $V(x)$ for $x$ in $U,$ $\bigcup_x V(x)$ is open by definition. Since all $V(x)$ are subsets of $U,$ $\bigcup_x V(x)\subseteq U$; since all $x\in U$ are at least inside its $V(x),$ $U\subseteq\bigcup_x V(x),$ implying $\bigcup_x V(x)=U$ and so $U$ is open.</p>
<div style="text-align: right;">\(\blacksquare\)</div>
<p>To get a topology from metric spaces, what we did is begin with open balls $B(x,r)$ and then define open sets as exactly those that can be gotten through unions and finite intersections from these balls. This can be generalized as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a <strong>basis</strong> for a topological space $(X,\tau)$ is a collection $\mathcal{B}\subseteq \tau$ of open subsets of $X$ such that all open sets of $X$ can be represented as the union of sets inside $\mathcal{B}.$</p>
<p>We often define a topology through a basis, just as we did in the metric case. I.e., we define a basis collection $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $X$ and define $\tau$ as all the sets obtained by unions and finite intersections of sets in $\mathcal{B}.$ To this actually work, we need the following two simple conditions (check any standard textbook for a proof):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For all $x\in X,$ there&rsquo;s a $B$ in $\mathcal{B}$ such that $x\in B$: i.e., $\mathcal{B}$ <strong>covers</strong> $X$;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For all sets $B_1,B_2\in \mathcal{B}$ and all $x\in B_1\cap B_2,$ there&rsquo;s a $B_3\in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x\in B_3$ and $B_3\subseteq B_1\cap B_2$ (just remember how we showed this for open ball previously).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also prove that, in order to show that a function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous, it suffices to prove it in relation to a basis $\mathcal{B}$ of $Y$: i.e., that $\inv{f}(B)$ is open in $X$ for all $B\in\mathcal{B}.$ This is particularly useful for metric spaces, with $\mathcal{B}$ being the open balls of $Y.$</p>
<h2 id="homeomorphisms-the-topological-notion-of-equality">Homeomorphisms: the topological notion of equality</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re now finally able to define what we actually mean by topology as rubber geometry. Indeed, what we meant by &ldquo;a continuous deformation without gluing or cutting&rdquo; in the introduction can be formally described as a <strong>bijective continuous function</strong> $f$! The property of &ldquo;being able to go back by a deformation of the same kind&rdquo; means that $\inv{f}$ should also be continuous. Thus, we have the following fundamental definition:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a <strong>homeomorhpism</strong> between topological spaces $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ is an inversible continuous function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ such that $\inv{f}:Y\rightarrow X$ is also continuous. We then say X and Y are <strong>homeomorphic</strong> and write $X\cong Y.$</p>
<p>IMG!!! HOMEO</p>
<p>If two spaces are homeomorphic, they&rsquo;re seen as equivalent by topology. That is, homeomorphic spaces can be seen as just different ways to name things: a point $x\in X$ is just a different name for another $y\in Y$, and an open set $U\subseteq X$ is just a different name for one open set $V\subseteq Y.$</p>
<p>Like equality, being homeomorphic is an <strong>equivalence relation</strong> (prove it): that is, $X\cong X;$ $X\cong Y$ implies $Y\cong X;$ $X\cong Y$ and $Y\cong Z$ imply $X\cong Z.$</p>
<p>Homeomorphisms allow us to make use of expressions like &ldquo;the circle&rdquo;, &ldquo;the torus&rdquo; etc., even though our circle might actually take the shape of a square&ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t matter, since, as we&rsquo;ll see, both are homeomorphic!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll say some property of a space $X$ is a <strong>topological invariant</strong> of $X$, or a topological <em>property</em> of it, if any space $Y$ homeomorphic to $X$ has the same property. The main goal of topology is finding invariants appliable to the largest classes of spaces possible.</p>
<p>Note that, from set theory, the cardinality of a space as a set is an invariant. This usually doesn&rsquo;t help us, since most interesting shapes have the same uncountable cardinality.</p>
<p>One main topological invariant we&rsquo;ll keep studying in this series are <strong>holes</strong>: they refrain transforming one space into another continously (i.e., without cutting or gluing): a disk and a disk with a hole in it, for example, aren&rsquo;t homeomorphic. To prove this will still take some time, though, but I hope it is visually intuitive.</p>
<p>IMG!!! OU GIF SLA, BURACO</p>
<p>Generally, mathematicians describe homeomorphisms explicitly, but rely on the visual intuition of the reader, which should be based on these simpler cases. Here are some of these simpler homeomorphisms which can be explicitly described (take $\ro^n$ and other real spaces with the metric topology from the Euclidean distance):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The obvious case: the identity $\text{id}_X:X\rightarrow X$ sending $x$ to $x$ itself;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embeddings: an embedding $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a homeomorphism from $X$ to a subset of $Y$&ndash; i.e., putting, viewing $X$ inside a larger space $Y;$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All one-point spaces are homeomorphic: for if $X=\{p\}$ and $Y=\{q\}$ (both with the only possible topology, composes solely of the point and the empty set), then $f:X\rightarrow Y$ sending $p$ to $q$ is a homeomorphism. It is common to then to speak of <strong>the point space</strong>, often denoted as $0$ to denote its triviality (it&rsquo;s a space though, not a number!);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isommetries</strong>: these are the bijective functions between metric spaces preserving the metric: i.e., $f:(X,d_X)\rightarrow (Y,d_Y)$ such that $d(x,y)=d(f(x),f(y)),$ with $f$ bijective. This is easy to prove using what we know so far. <strong>Rotations, reflections and translations</strong> are examples of isommetries. These will become very important later on when we study the topology of cellular automata;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linear scalings: since these are just multiplication by scalars on $\ro^n$;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open intervals $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ in $\ro$: applying translation and scaling suffices. The same applies for all open balls in $\ro^n;$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The disk $\bar{B}(0, 1)$ and the square $[0,1]^2$ inside $\ro^2$: this can be described using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinates">polar coordinates</a> as $f:[0,1]^2\rightarrow \bar{B}(0, 1),$</p>
</li>
</ul>
$$f(\rho, \theta) = \left( \frac{\rho}{ \max(|\cos \theta|, |\sin \theta|)}, \theta\right).$$<ul>
<li>$\ro$ and the interval $(0,1)$: this may be surprising, but it&rsquo;s true: for topology, the reals and an open interval inside it are really the same. A famous homeomorphism is the <strong>logistic function</strong> $\sigma:\ro\rightarrow (0,1),$</li>
</ul>
$$\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}},$$<p>which &ldquo;encapsulates&rdquo; $\ro$ onto $(0,1).$ Its inverse is the <strong>logit function</strong> $\text{logit }:(0,1)\rightarrow \ro,$ defined as $\text{logit }p=\log\frac{p}{1-p}$&ndash; which is also continuous. Writing the variable here as $p$ is suggestive: the fraction $\frac{p}{1-p}$ can be seen as the odds (30% to 70%, 99% to 1% etc.) of a given event with probability $p$. Thus the logistic function can be seen as a function taking a real number and returning the logarithm of an odd. This makes these two functions widely appliable in statistics, specially in machine learning.</p>
<p>IMG!!! LOGISTIC</p>
<p>Homeomorphisms from $\ro$ to $(0,1)$ are usually called <strong>sigmoids</strong>, due to their graphs being s-shaped.</p>
<ul>
<li>$\ro^n$ with the $\mathcal{l}^p$ metrics: these are all homeomorphic as topological. Actually, their topologies are <strong>the exact same</strong>: sure, their balls might be different, but they&rsquo;re open in any other of these metrics as well. This is fundamentally because of the following theorem, which states that, when two metrics are not that different from one another, then they have the same topology:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: If $d_1$ and $d_2$ are two metrics on the same set $X$ and there are constants $K_1, K_2$ such that, for any $x,y\in X,$ we have</p>
$$K_1 d_2(x,y) \leq d_1(x,y) \leq K_2 d_2(x,y)$$<p>(in which case the metrics are said to be <strong>equivalent</strong>), then the metric spaces $(X,d_1)$ and $(X,d_2)$ produce the same topology (i.e., every open set in one is open in the other).</p>
<p>This is the case for all the $\mathcal{l^p}$ metrics in any $\ro^n.$ Proving this and the theorem is quite an educative exercise on the relation between metric and topological spaces.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the same can&rsquo;t be said for sets of functions with the $L^p$ metrics: indeed, different $p$ give us completely different topologies. This was actually one of the main sources for defining abstract topological spaces in the earlier 20th century, as many theorems were valid for some $L^p$ distances, and some not for others. This led to the consolidation of <strong>functional analysis</strong>, which is linear algebra applied to the different (infinite dimensional) vector spaces of functions&ndash; an area that later on lead to fundamental advances in quantum mechanics, statistics, topology itself and many other applications.</p>
<p>Beware: <strong>from now on we&rsquo;ll not describe explicitly most of the homeomorphisms we mention!</strong></p>
<p>Proving that spaces satisfying certain properties are homeomorphic is, in general, hard. However, it may be even harder to prove the opposite: that two spaces <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> homeomorphic. Proving the latter is one of the main tasks of topology. Here are some non-homeomorphic spaces and indicatives of thereof:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$\ro^n$ and $\ro^m$ for different $n,m.$ You think this is obvious? Intuitively, sure&ndash; but not formally! One way to prove it is to show that, after taking the origin from both $\ro^n$ and $\ro^m,$ the holes left in them are of different dimensions&ndash; something that we&rsquo;ll soon study closer when we define homology groups;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dimensionality: generally, if two shapes have different dimensions, they aren&rsquo;t homeomorphic. We&rsquo;ll discuss dimensionality properly soon;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open and closed intervals: indeed, $(a,b)$ is not homeomorphic to $[a,b],$ and similarly for all open and closed balls $B(x, r)$ and $\bar{B}(x,r)$ in any $\ro^n$. This has to do with the property of compactness, which we&rsquo;ll see later on, but the idea is that in $(a,b)$ you can get infinitely close to the extremities of the interval, without ever getting to them, which doesn&rsquo;t happen in $[a,b];$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holes: these are the most important indicatives of non-homeomorphic spaces, and formalizing what &ldquo;a hole&rdquo; is will concern us for most of the rest of the series. Examples include: a disk and and its boundary circle aren&rsquo;t homeomorphic since there&rsquo;s a hole in the latter; similarly for, say, a 2D sphere and a cylinder, or with the torus (donut shape): these all have different holes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also study two properties which are very strong topological invariants in this article: connectivity and compactness. The latter will play an important role in the topological analysis of cellular automata.</p>
<h2 id="boundaries-and-closed-sets">Boundaries and closed sets</h2>
<p>One further thing topological spaces allow us to define, in analogy to metric ones, is the notion of the <strong>boundary</strong> of a subset. Think of the open ball $B(0,1)$ in $\ro^2$ and the circle $C$ of radius one which is its frontier. How are these sets topologically related? Visually, even though $B(0,1)$ doesn&rsquo;t contain $C$, its outward points tend to $C$&ndash; in the proper converge meaning. Similarly, every point of $C$ is &ldquo;topologically glued&rdquo; to $B(0,1),$ in the sense that, if $x\in C,$ every neighborhood of $x$ intersects with $B(0,1).$</p>
<p>This &ldquo;adherence property&rdquo; is fundamental to the notion of a boundary:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: for a subset $S$ of a topological space $X$, a point $x\in X$ is an <strong>adherent point</strong> of $S$ if, for every neighborhood $U$ of $x,$ $U$ and $S$ intersect: $U\cap S\neq \emptyset.$ Of course, all points of $S$ are adherent to it. The set of all adherent points to $S$ is called its <strong>closure</strong>, written $\bar{S}.$</p>
<p>In the example above, every point in $C$ is adherent to $B(0,1)$ and the closure of $B(0,1)$ is the closed ball $\bar{B}(0,1)=B(0,1)\cup C.$</p>
<p>Addherent points of a set $S,$ but not in $S$ are called <strong>limit points</strong>. These are a bridge between metric and topological spaces. For if $\{x_n\}$ is a sequence <em>in a metric space</em> and $S$ is the set of points $x_n,$ then a point $x$ addherent to $S$ can occur only if there are elements of the sequence infinitely close to $x.$ This doesn&rsquo;t mean necessarily that $x_n\rightarrow x,$ but at least that there is a <strong>subsequence</strong> of it that converges to $x.$ Thus limit points of $S$ are the points of convergence of subsequences of $\{x_n\}$ (disconsidering elements of the sequence that repeat infinitely). For example, the sequence $x_n=\frac{1}{n}+(-1)^n$ doesn&rsquo;t converge, but it has two subsequences $x_{2n}$ and $x_{2n+1}$ converging to $1$ and $-1,$ respectively&ndash; so that $1$ and $-1$ are limit, or addherent points to the set of points of the sequence.</p>
<p>Thus limit points allow us to speak of convergence in general topological spaces: $x_n\rightarrow x$ if $x$ is the only limit point of $S$ as above.</p>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>These notions allow us too to define closed sets (like the closed balls $\bar{B}(x,r)$ in metric spaces) for general topological spaces:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a subset $S$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be <strong>closed</strong> if it&rsquo;s equal to its closure: $S=\bar{S}.$</p>
<p>Now, note that $C=\bar{B}(0,1)\setminus B(0,1).$ The general idea is that <strong>&ldquo;boundary=closed-open&rdquo;</strong>. Open sets, since they&rsquo;re &ldquo;fat&rdquo; (as we introduced them), visually form the interior mass of a shape, while adherent points form a crust around it. This gives the following definition:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: the <strong>interior</strong> of a subset $S$ of a topological space $X$ is the union of all open sets $U$ of $X$ contained inside $S.$ The interior of $S$ is usually written as $\text{int } S.$</p>
<p>IMG!!! CLOSURE, INTERIOR E BOUNDARY (formato q é um disco tangente a um segmento)</p>
<p>With this, the proper formula for the boundary can be given:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: the <strong>boundary</strong> of a subset $S\subseteq X$ is its closure minus its interior: $\partial S= \bar{S}\setminus \text{int } S.$</p>
<p>This definition allows us now to use the intuitive notions of boundary and frontier in the general topological context.</p>
<p>Open and closed sets are, literally, complementary notions. For, if $C$ is closed in a space $X$, then $X\setminus C$ is open: otherwise, there&rsquo;d an $x\in X\setminus C$ with all of its neighborhoods not completely inside $X\setminus C.$ Thus $x$ is an addherent point of $C$ not in $C$&ndash; a contradiction. Conversely, if a subset $C$ is the complement $X\setminus U$ of an open $U$ in $X,$ then all addherent points of $C$ are contained in $C$: for if $x$ is addherent to $C$ but not in it, it is in $X\setminus C= U$ and all its neighborhoods intersect $C$&ndash; implying $U$ isn&rsquo;t open, a contradiction. We thus get:</p>
<p><strong>Proposition</strong>: a set is closed in $X$ if, and only if, it is the complement of an open set in $X.$</p>
<p>Funnily enough, there are sets that are both open and closed: they&rsquo;re called <strong>clopen</strong> sets. For now, you can see that $X$ and $\emptyset$ are clopen, but we&rsquo;ll meet more subsets of this kind later on.</p>
<h2 id="some-common-topologies">Some common topologies</h2>
<h3 id="basic-examples">Basic examples</h3>
<p>That should be it for definitions and constructions so far. Let&rsquo;s get into some examples.</p>
<p>First of all, note that every set $X$ can be given a topology: this can be done using the <strong>trivial topology</strong> $\{X, \emptyset\}.$ It&rsquo;s not very interesting: the only open sets are the empty set and $X$ itself. Another less trivial way is to take as basis $\mathcal{B}$ all the one-point subsets $\{x\}$ for $x\in X.$ The resulting topology is the set of all subsets of $X$, and is called the <strong>discrete topology</strong>. It is metrizable by the metric</p>
$$d(x,y)=
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } x\neq y\\
0, & \text{else}
\end{cases}
$$<p>called the discrete metric (note that the ball $B(x,r)$ is just $\{x\}$ for any $r<1$, giving the discrete basis).</p>
<p>You can check that the graph metric described before induces the discrete topology on the set of vertices, no matter the graph.</p>
<p>Similarly, the space $\mathcal{A}^n$ of strings of length $n$ on an alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ with the Hamming distance has the discrete topology, since for any $r<1$ the open ball $B(x,r)$ contains only $x$&ndash; and you can see that the Hamming distance for finite strings is really just an extension of the discrete topology to each position. For infinite strings, however, things get more interesting, as we&rsquo;ll see when studying cellular automata.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a good exercise: prove that, if $(X,\tau)$ is a topological space such that all infinite subsets of $X$ are open, then $\tau$ is the discrete topology.</p>
<p>You can topologize any union of topological spaces $(X, \tau_X)$ and $(Y, \tau_Y)$ by giving $X\cup Y$ the topology $\tau_X\cup \tau_Y.$ Open sets in $X$ and $Y$ remain open, and there are no open sets with elements both in $X$ and in $Y$: the spaces are &ldquo;disconnected,&rdquo; so to speak&ndash; a notion we&rsquo;ll later on describe properly. This space is called the <strong>disjoint union</strong> of $X$ and $Y$, and it&rsquo;s custom to denote it as $X\amalg Y.$ Since there&rsquo;s no relation here between the topologies of the two spaces, disjoint unions don&rsquo;t bring anything new and are just used as a formality.
IMG!!!</p>
<p>It can also educative to consider some topologies on finite sets. For example, in $\{0,1\},$ the topology</p>
$$\{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{0,1\}\}$$<p>is called the <strong>Sierpinski topology</strong>. You can try to verify its properties whenever we introduce a new topological concept.</p>
<p>IMG!! SIERPINSKI</p>
<h3 id="spheres-and-donuts-dimension-intrinsic-and-extrinsic-views">Spheres and donuts: dimension, intrinsic and extrinsic views</h3>
<p>That&rsquo;s all educative and even intersting per se, but where are our cool figures of mind-blowing shapes, our familiar friends the sphere and the torus&ndash; <strong>where are our donuts?!</strong> Indeed, most introductory courses on topology don&rsquo;t really get to these and focus on the more set-theoretical aspects of topology&ndash; the so-called <strong>point-set topology</strong>. This can be frustrating for many beginners, so let me turn to more familiar shapes and spaces.</p>
<p>We know where to start: with the reals $\ro^n.$ In this series, we&rsquo;ll <strong>always</strong> use the metric topology coming from the Euclidean metric&ndash; which is homeomorphic to the one using the other $\mathcal{l^p}$ distances. Of course there are other possible topologies on $\ro$ (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-topology">the K-topology</a> is a common counter-example found in point-set topology textbooks), but the Euclidean one is the only one we&rsquo;ll actually study here.</p>
<p>Sure, we know how to topologize $\ro^n,$ but what about surfaces and other shapes living in it&ndash; like circles and spheres? There are two ways: <strong>extrinsic</strong> and <strong>intrinsic</strong> descriptions.</p>
<p>With extrinsic descriptions, we define our spaces as subsets of some $\ro^n$: for example, seeing the circle as something inside the plane $\ro^2.$ For this, we can use <strong>subspace topology</strong>. Generally, if you have a topological space $(X,\tau)$ and some subset $Y$ of $X,$ you can define the subspace topology $\tau'$ on $Y$ (induced by $\tau$) as</p>
$$\tau'=\{U\cap Y \text{, where } U \text{ is open in } (X,\tau)\}.$$<p>You can check that this is a topology for any $s$ and $Y\subseteq X.$ You can also see that, for a metric space $(X,d)$ with the metric topology, the subspace topology of a subspace $Y\subseteq X$ is the same as the metric topology of $Y$ with the restriction of $d$ to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically immediate from the definition that, if $Y\subseteq X$ is given the subspace topology, then the <strong>inclusion function</strong> $i:Y\rightarrow X$ sending $y\in Y$ to $y$ itself is continuous.</p>
<p>For lower dimensional shapes, that&rsquo;s how we tend to think of them: as living inside some larger space. Intrinsic definitions, however, can unsatisfactory for some reasons. First, it limits us a lot: beyond dimension $3$ our visual intuition ceases being that helpful. There are many interesting spaces we&rsquo;ll study in this series that can&rsquo;t be properly seen inside 3D space.</p>
<p>Second, it is conceptually quite deceiving: being inside some other larger space shouldn&rsquo;t be a defining property of some topological space. Imagine yourself as an ant on the surface of a sphere. You have only two movement directions: forwards/backwards and left/right. Why would you care about some third extra dimension (up/down), if you can&rsquo;t move along it? The sphere might as well be inside a $23$-dimensional space, it is irrelevant for you&ndash; and so it should be for the sphere as a topological space.</p>
<p>IMGS!!!</p>
<p>This leads us to the <strong>intrinsic</strong> description of spaces: define them without seeing them as embedded in some $\ro^n.$</p>
<p>This all has a lot to do with the notion of <strong>dimension</strong>. By dimension, we usually mean the <strong>degrees of freedom</strong> available in a space: i.e., the general directions of movement possible inside it. This is an intrinsic notion. Because in the sphere as described above the ant has only go forwards/backwards or left/right, we say the sphere is two-dimensional. Similarly, if you were restricted to a circle, you could only go forwards or backwards, and a circle is one-dimensional.</p>
<p>Intuitively, a shape has dimension $d$ whenever it locally &ldquo;looks like&rdquo; $\ro^d$. Intrinsically, circle locally looks like a line segment, and the sphere&ndash; seen at a closer distance&ndash; looks like a portion of the plane&ndash; something we experience everyday using maps to represent the small portion of the round planet we live in.</p>
<p>Some people, however, think it&rsquo;d be more intuitive to say a sphere is three-dimensional. Now let me ask: is a circle inside the three-dimensional space $\ro^3$ three-dimensional? Of course not! The dimension of a shape doesn&rsquo;t care where you <strong>embedd</strong> it! A sphere could also be embedded in the four-dimensional space $\ro^4$: is it four-dimensional then?! Think of dimension intrinsically, not extrinsically. I.e., dimension is defined as if you could only move in the shape, not from any other, external point of view.</p>
<p>2D spaces are so common and important that they receive the exclusive name of <strong>surfaces</strong>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll properly define spaces intrinsicaly in the next subsection. For now, let&rsquo;s <strong>finally</strong> get into some concrete examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$\ro^n$: the reals with the Eucliedean distance&ndash; the only topology we&rsquo;ll consider here for them. We know them already;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Points: sets of a single point ${p},$ with $p\in\ro$ are are said to be 0-dimensional&ndash; we actually define $\ro^0$ as being the set solely containing the origin, $\ro^0=\{0\};$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The natural and integer numbers: with the subspace topology, they have the discrete topology. They&rsquo;re seen as 0-dimensional spaces as well;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intervals: both open $(a,b)=\{x\in\ro\mid a < x < b\}$ and closed $[a,b]=\{x\in\ro\mid a \leq x \leq b\}$ with subspace topology. These are one-dimensional. The unit interval $[0,1]$ is often just written $I.$</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The interval $I$ is a very important space, because we can use it to define paths in any topological space $X.$ We say a <strong>path</strong> in $X$ is a continuous function $p:I\rightarrow X.$ It is common to call the image $p(I)\rightarrow X$ as &ldquo;the path&rdquo; as well, instead of the function $p.$</p>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<ul>
<li>Cubes: these are the $n$-dimensional products $I^n.$ A 2D cube $I^2$ is a square and a 3D one a cube in the usual sense. Since $I^n\subseteq \ro^n$, these can get the subspace topology from the reals; but what if we wanted to topologize it without seeing it as embedded in another space? We&rsquo;ll later on see how to give a topology to the cartesian product of spaces;</li>
</ul>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<ul>
<li>$S^n$: the <strong>spheres</strong>. For $n=2$, we get the sphere (a hollow ball), but also a circle with the same description. These may be realized as the set of points with Euclidean distance equal to 1 from the origin of $\ro^{n+1}$:</li>
</ul>
$$S^n=\{x\in \ro^{n+1}\mid \sqrt{x_1^2+...+x_{n+1}^2}=1 \}$$<p>For $n=1$, this is a circle; for $n=2$, the usual shape we mean by a &ldquo;ball&rdquo;. Note that $S^0$ is, by definition, the two points $\{0,1\}$ inside $\ro;$</p>
<p>IMGS</p>
<ul>
<li>$D^n$: the <strong>disks</strong>. There are just the $S^n$ with their hollow interior filled. Equivalently, they&rsquo;re just the closed balls of distance one from the center of $\ro^n$:</li>
</ul>
$$D^n=\{x\in \ro^{n+1}\mid \sqrt{x_1^2+...+x_{n+1}^2}\leq 1 \}$$<p>$D^n$ is an $n$-dimensional space, as the index tells. $D^1$ is the same thing as the closed interval $I=[0,1].$</p>
<p>Note that the $S^n$ are the boundary of the $D^{n+1}.$</p>
<p>IMGS</p>
<ul>
<li>Cylinder: as a set, this is just $S^1\times I$&ndash; i.e., a circle elongated along one extra dimension. It is a two-dimenisonal space and we see it as a subspace of the three-dimensional space $\ro^3$;</li>
</ul>
<p>IMG</p>
<ul>
<li>The torus $T^2$: this is the shape of a hollow donut. Torii can be concretely described by the internal radius $r$ of the tube and the distance $R$ from the center (usually the origin) of the torus to the center of the tube, with $R>r.$ Algebraically, then, a torus can be seen as the set</li>
</ul>
$$\{(x,y,z)\in \ro^3\mid (\sqrt{x^2+y^2}-R)^2+z^2=r^2\},$$<p>where the $(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}-R)^2$ part represents the distance of a point to the tube.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a more topological way to describe $T^2$, though. Indeed, any point in the torus can be <strong>uniquely</strong> described by two circular coordinates, i.e., two angles:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The &ldquo;transversal&rdquo; angle around the whole doughnut;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &ldquo;longidutinal&rdquo; around around the tube made by the torus.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>This means that we can specify every point uniquely in $T^2$ by two angles in $S^1$. This is the same as saying that $T^2=S^1\times S^1,$ that the torus is the cartesian product of two circles. The description before, with $T^2$ embedded in $\ro^3,$ allowed us to topologize it as a subspace; we&rsquo;ll soon see how to give it a topology just by seeing it as a product.</p>
<p>IMG!!! GIf do torus formando com dois rcicles</p>
<ul>
<li>$n$ handle torus: these are surfaces like the torus, but, instead of one hole in the middle, they have $n$ holes, or, rather, $n$ handles. They&rsquo;re also called the <strong>genus</strong> $g$ <strong>surfaces</strong>, this $g$ being the amount of holes, from $1$ (the standard torus) to as many as you wish;</li>
</ul>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<ul>
<li>The multidimensional torii $T^n$: based on the description $T^2=S^1\times S^1,$ we define $T^n$ as the product of $n$ circles $S^1$;</li>

<h3 id="two-bizarre-lines-separation-and-countability-axioms">Two bizarre lines: separation and countability axioms</h3>
<p>Before we further study the visually intuitive spaces presented above, I&rsquo;d like to remind the reader that topology is full of counter-intuitive, &ldquo;pathological&rdquo; spaces. Here are two bizarre variations of the real line $\ro,$ intended to show that <strong>constructing spaces based on the real numbers can get quite tricky without some proper restrictions</strong>.</p>
<p>The first variation concerns the notion of <strong>separability</strong> in topology. See, one type of argument we often take for granted in metric spaces is how points and sets in them can be separated and distnguished. For example, if you have a point $x$ and another $y$ in your metric space, then there is an open ball $B(x,r)$ containing $x$ but not $y$&ndash; just take $r< d(x,y).$ Similarly, $x$ and $y$ have disjoint open balls containing one but not the other&ndash; just take $B(x,r)$ and $B(y,r)$ with $r < d(x,y)/2,$ the triangular inequality guaranteeing they won&rsquo;t intersect.</p>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>These arguments are very intuitive and almost obvious for metric spaces, but general topological spaces may not satisfy these properties! This gives rise to the <strong>separability axioms</strong>, which is a hierarchy of desirable properties for topological spaces in regards to the separability of points (and subsets too) by open sets. These tell how much we can separate and distinguish points topologically in our space.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll need only one of these axioms, which is the following:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a topological space $X$ is a <strong>Hausdorff space</strong> if, for every pair of distinct points $x,y\in X,$ there are open neighborhoods $U$ of $x$ and $V$ of $y$ such that $U\cap V=\emptyset.$</p>
<p>IMG!!! Hausdorff</p>
<p>The Hausdorff property is sometimes denoted as the <strong>T<sub>2</sub> axiom</strong>, with separability properties generally being denoted as some &ldquo;T<sub>n</sub> axiom&rdquo;. You can read more definitions on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_axiom">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a non-Hausdorff space based on the real line:  the <strong>line with two origins</strong>. As a set, it is $\ro$ with an extra point, called the <em>second origin</em> and denoted $0^*$&ndash; that is, $X=\ro\cup \{0^*\}$. All open subsets of $\ro$ remain open in $X.$ If $U$ open in $\ro$ contains $0$, then we define an open set $U^*$ in $X$ which is the same as $U,$ but with $0$ swaped for $0^*.$ That way the origins $0$ and $0^*$ are <strong>topologically inseparable</strong>: there&rsquo;s no neighborhood of one that doesn&rsquo;t intersect a neighborhood of the other. I.e., the line with two origins isn&rsquo;t Hausdorff.</p>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>The second variation of the line deals with the idea of <strong>countability</strong>. This concerns how large your space is by measuring if points in it can be approximated by a smaller subset. The idea is that the reals enjoy a quite useful property: every point in the real line can be approximated by a sequence of rational numbers. This means that there&rsquo;s always a rational as close as you want from a real. Topologically, this implies every neighborhood $U$ of a point $x$ must contain rational numbers&ndash; i.e., that $U\cap \mathbb{Q}\neq \emptyset.$ We say that $\mathbb{Q}$ is <strong>dense</strong> inside $\ro$: generally, a subspace $Y$ of a topological space $X$ is <strong>dense</strong> in $X$ if, for every $U$ open in $X$, we have $U\cap Y\neq \emptyset.$ If $X$ has a countable dense subset&ndash; like $\ro$ in the standard topology does&ndash;, it is said to be <strong>separable</strong>.</p>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a stronger version of this idea. See, rational numbers can actually be used to <strong>generate</strong> all open sets of $\ro.$ If $(a,b)$ is an open interval, then it can be seen as the infinite union $\cup_n^\infty(a_n, b_n),$ with $a_n$ a sequence of rationals larger than $a$ and converging to $a$, and $b_n$ rationals less than $b$ converging to it. This means that the open intervals with rational extremities generate all intervals&ndash; and, thus, form a basis for the standard topology of $\ro.$ This is a stronger property than being dense: not only all open sets can&rsquo;t be separated from the rationals (density), but they&rsquo;re actually all describable using rational numbers!</p>
<p>Generally speaking, we have the following generalization:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a topological space $X$ is <strong>second-countable</strong> if it has a countable basis.</p>
<p>We just proved above that (using the basis $(a, b)$ for $a,b\in\mathbb{Q}$) the reals are second-countable. It is a good exercise on topological bases to prove that all second-countable spaces are separable&ndash; the opposite, however, isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>Before we construct our second bizarre line, we need to define a new kind of topology. See, intervals in $\ro$ are defined using the strict order $ < $ on the line. Instead of using the Euclidean metric, we could equivalently just use this order to define the topology of $\ro$&ndash; and this we can do for general sets as well. With this, we can make the following definition:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: the <strong>order topology</strong> on a totally ordered set $X$ is the topology with basis all the intervals</p>
$$(a,b)=\{x\in X\mid a< x \text{ and } x < b \},$$<p>for $a,b\in X$ and $a< b.$</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one special order that will concern us now. If you have a product $X\times Y$ of two totally ordered sets $X$ and $Y,$ then the <strong>lexicographical order</strong> on $X\times Y$ is as follows: if $p_1=(x_1,y_1)$ and $p_2=(x_2,y_2)$ are two pairs, then $p_1< p_2$ if $x_1< x_2$; if $x_1 = x_2,$ then $p_1< p_2$ if $y_1 < y_2.$ That is, like in a dictionary, we first search for the entry on the first coordinate (like our first letter), then, if the values are equal, on the second one.</p>
<p>The lexicographical order allows us to give another definition of the real line. Divide $\ro$ the intervals $I_n=[n, n+1),$ for $n$ an integer. If you want to compare two points $x,y\in \ro,$ you can use this subdivision. First, if, say, $x$ lies in $I_n$ and $y$ in a different $I_m,$ you don&rsquo;t need to go further: if $n>m,$ then $x>y,$ else $x< y.$ If they lie on the same such interval $I_n$, then you need to check who&rsquo;s larger inside $I_n.$</p>
<p>This means $\ro$ is homeomorphic to $\zo\times [0,1)$ with the with the order topology from the lexicographical order&ndash; the homeomorphism being $f:\zo\times [0,1) \rightarrow \ro$ being simply $f(n, x) = n + x.$ I.e., $n\in \zo$ gives the integer part of a number, $x\in[0,1)$ its fractional part.</p>
<p>This makes sense: the real line is really a (countable) infinite amount of intervals $[0,1)$ attached to one another. But what if this amount becomes uncountable? Then we get this:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: the <strong>long line</strong> is the space $\ro\times [0,1)$ with the order topology from the lexicographical order.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an informal way of trying to visualize this definition: the long line is also composed of the intervals $[0,1),$ but between any of two such intervals there is an infinite amount of other ones&ndash; just like in between two real numbers there are infinitely many other ones, and this can&rsquo;t be changed by any reordering. Contrast this to the normal line: there&rsquo;s nothing between two $[0,1)$ attached to each other&ndash; just like there&rsquo;s nothing between two consecutive integers.</p>
<p>Another way is to see each point of the real line as representing a whole interval&ndash; how colossally infinite is this space?!</p>
<p>IMG!!! PRA CADA REAL, UM [0,1)</p>
<p>The careful reader, however, has probably noted something: the <strong>set</strong> $\ro\times[0,1)$ is actually completely familiar! It can be seen inside the plane $\ro^2$ as an infinite horizontal strip. It doesn&rsquo;t seem so mysterious in this version. The difference lies in topology: $\ro\times[0,1)$ with the Euclidean topology is one thing, with the long line&rsquo;s another one. The latter has an order topology, which can be seen as trying to representing the set $\ro\times[0,1)$ as a huge, zigzagging line. Notice too how open sets in these two topologies are completely different: in particular, the identity $i:(\ro\times[0,1), \tau_1)\rightarrow (\ro\times[0,1),\tau_2)$ sending $x$ to $x$ itself, but between these two different topologies, is not even continuous.</p>
<p>IMG!!! ORDEM EM RX[0,1), LINHA ZIGZAGUEANDO</p>
<p>Actually, the proper definition of the long line can change a little from author to author, and here we have avoided using too much set theory by having $\ro\times [0,1)$ instead of $\omega_1\times [0,1)$&ndash; $\omega_1$ being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_uncountable_ordinal">first uncountable ordinal</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a variation of the long line called the <strong>long ray</strong>, which is $[0,\infty)\times[0,1)$ with topology as above. We&rsquo;ll use it later as a counter-example.</p>
<h3 id="manifolds">Manifolds</h3>
<h4 id="topological-manifolds">Topological manifolds</h4>
<p>The shapes we described in the penultimate have all the property that, locally, they &ldquo;look like&rdquo; some $\ro^n,$ as we previously discussed. Another way of viewing this is saying that $M$ locally looks like some graph of a function. The last section, however, showed that studying spaces based on the reals $\ro^n$ can be quite tricky without restrictions. Here&rsquo;s a definition of the more intuitive spaces that we actually wish to work on:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a second-countable, Hausdorff space $M$ is an $n$<strong>-dimenisonal manifold</strong> if, for every point $x\in M$, there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $U$ is homeomorphic to an open subset of $\ro^n.$</p>
<p>We add the conditions of being second-countable and Hausdorff so that we don&rsquo;t have to deal with &ldquo;long&rdquo; or &ldquo;doubled&rdquo; spaces, in the terminology of the previous section.</p>
<p>See, by the way, how this an intrinsic view of spaces: we don&rsquo;t assume they live inside some $\ro^n$!</p>
<p>We say a pair $(U, \phi)$ of an open subset $U\subseteq M$ and a homeomorphism $\phi$ from $U$ to an open subspace of $\ro^n$ is a <strong>chart</strong>; a collection $\{U_i,\phi_i\}$ of charts with $\{U_i\}$ covering $M$ is an <strong>manifold structure</strong> of $M.$ To prove your space is a manifold, you don&rsquo;t need to find a unique homeomorphism for every point, as long as you can find an structure for the space. It&rsquo;s common to describe manifold structures only by the collection of open sets, when one can assume the reader can describe the homeomorphisms by himself.</p>
<p>The topographic terminology is fitting: every chart can $(U, \phi)$ be seen as defining a <strong>local coordinate</strong> in $U$ based on $\phi$&ndash; that is, describing points locally using cartesian coordinates.</p>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>Here are some descriptions of spaces as manifolds:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$\ro^n$ and open subsets of them: the spaces themselves together with the identity provide a manifold structure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$S^1$: a manifold structure can be given by the open sets $S^1\setminus \{p\}$ and $S^1\setminus \{q\},$ with $p,q\in S^1$ any two points in the circle. You can describe the necessary homeomorphisms if you want to, but visually it should be clear that both sets are homeomorphic to intervals;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$S^2$: similarly to the 1D case, $S^2\setminus \{p\}$ and $S^2\setminus \{q\}$ provide a manifold structure, with any $p,q\in S^2.$ Constructing the homeomorphisms can take use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinates">polar coordinates</a>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$T^2$:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, however, that the definition above doesn&rsquo;t allow for bounded spaces, like $D^2:$ a point lying in its circular boundary can&rsquo;t move in 2 directions freely (it can&rsquo;t go beyond the disk). This is easy to solve: instead of considering $\ro^n$, consider the upper <strong>half-spaces</strong> $\mathbb{H}^n,$ with $\mathbb{H}=\{x\in\ro\mid x\geq 0\}$ (i.e., the subspaces of $\ro^n$ of points with only positive or zero coordinates). Give $\mathbb{H^n}$ the subspace topology inside $\ro^n$: then we have open sets with boundaries (those near the boundary of $\mathbb{H}^n$ itself). If we want to allow manifolds with boundaries, then we should use $\mathbb{H}^n$ as a model space, instead of $\ro^n,$ with points in the boundary of our bounded manifold being matched to those on the boundary of $\mathbb{H}^n.$</p>

<p>This allows us the following definition:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a space $M$ is an $n$<strong>-dimenisonal manifold with boundary</strong> if, for every point $x\in M$, there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $U$ is homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb{H}^n.$</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I: the manifold structure can be given using the open sets $[0,1)$ and $(0,1]$ (both homeomorphic to, say, $[0,1)$ inside $\mathbb{H},$ which is open);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$D^2$: the structure can be given using the open sets $\{(x,y)\in D^2\mid y>-0.1\}$ and $\{(x,y)\in D^2\mid y<0.1\}$</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>Here are some examples of spaces that <strong>aren&rsquo;t</strong> manifolds (with or without boundary):</p>
<ul>
<li>Branched spaces: visually, these are spaces like manifolds, but with specific points in which the space branches itself, like below. The branching points don&rsquo;t satisfy the manifold property (we&rsquo;ll prove this when studying connectivity);</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Intersecting figures: lines, surfaces etc. having self-intersections, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folium_of_Descartes">folium of Descartes</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemniscate">lemniscate</a>. These are branched in the intersections.</li>
</ul>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>Branching intersecting points are examples of <strong>singularities</strong>: points impeding a space of becoming a manifold. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_theory">Singularity theory</a> is a pretty important topic in areas like chaos theory and algebraic geometry.</p>
<p>How do the extrinsic and intrinsic views work together? This is actually quite non-trivial. We&rsquo;re generally interested if we can embed $M$ on some $\ro^n,$ in such a way that it can be seen extrinsically as inside some $\ro^n.$ For the cases we&rsquo;ve been studying so far, this seems possible&ndash; if not obvious. But, as we&rsquo;ll later see, <strong>there are some surfaces that can&rsquo;t be embedded in</strong> $\ro^3$! Generally, it&rsquo;s not clear if every manifold can be embedded inside some $\ro^n.$</p>
<p>Thankfully, we have the following theorem:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: every $n$-dimensional manifold can be embedded inside $\ro^{2n+1}.$</p>
<p>Its proof is, frankly, quite long and tedious. It is proven by Munkres in different sections of his book, beginning at 4-5 (&ldquo;Partitions of Unity&rdquo;) and being properly concluded at 7-9 (&ldquo;An Introduction to Dimension Theory&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 id="smooth-manifolds">Smooth manifolds</h4>
<p><strong>This section is skippable for most of the series</strong>, but, if you know some calculus, it presents one of the most important concepts of all of topology.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another very important class of manifolds: <strong>smooth manifolds</strong>. These rely on calculus, so we we&rsquo;ll try to avoid them until necessary, but the idea is that they locally look like graphs of smooth functions (a function $f:\ro^n\rightarrow\ro^m$ is smooth if every one of its components can be differentiated infinitely many times everywhere). This avoids stuff like sharp corners: the perimeter of a square, for example, is a manifold, but not a smooth one because of its corners, which aren&rsquo;t smooth. With this, you can do calculus&ndash; i.e., computing curvatures and areas&ndash; inside these spaces, which is extremely useful and powerful.</p>
<p>How to formalize this intuition? Imagine the simple case of some continuous function $f:M\rightarrow \ro,$ and say we want to find the derivatives of $f$ on a point $p\in M.$ We know how to do this if $M$ were some $\ro^n$: express this function in terms of coordinates $x_1,...,x_n$ and then compute the partial derivatives $\pard{f}{x_i}(p)$ on $p.$ But what is a partial derivative? It&rsquo;s the change of $f$ in the direction $i.$ Formally, if you have a path $\gamma:(-1,1)\rightarrow \ro^n$ with $\gamma(0)=p$ (i.e., $p$ is in the center of $\gamma$)QQQQQQQGAMMA CAMINHOEHQCAMINHO, then you define the partial derivative $\pard{f}{x_i}(p)$ as</p>

<p>The problem is that $M$ might not be $\ro^n.$ What should we do then? Well, if $p$ is contained in a chart $(U,\phi),$ then $f$ can&rsquo;t be directly derivated, but $f\circ \inv{\phi}$ is a function of type $\ro^n\rightarrow \ro,$ whose partial derivatives can be computed. What $f\circ \inv{\phi}$ means is that we&rsquo;re seeing some open subset of $\ro^n$ (the set $\inv{\phi}(U)$) as a parametrized version of $U,$ and then applied $f$ to this local parametrization.</p>
<p>Why not then define the derivatives $\pard{f}{x_i}(p),$ for $p\in U,$ as those of $f\circ \inv{\phi}$? There&rsquo;s an issue: if $p$ is inside another chart $(V,\psi),$ what if we use $\phi$ instead of $\phi$ to get $f\circ \inv{\psi}$? Would the derivatives using different parametrizations be the same? A simple example shows that no: for the interval $(0,1)$ take $f:(0,1)\rightarrow$ as the identity. As charts, choose $\big((0,1), i\big),$ with $i$ the identity, and $\big((0,1), g\big),$ with $g(x)=2x.$ Then $f\circ\inv{i}(x)=f(x)=x$ and $f\circ \inv{g}(x)=f(x/2)=x/2,$ with these two functions having different derivatives.</p>
<p>That is,</p>
<p>First of all, give our space $M$ a manifold structure. How do we . Simple: turn these functions into functions of the type $\ro^n\rightarrow \ro^n,$ with which we know how to do calculus. For two charts $(U, \phi)$ and $(V, \psi),$ this can be done by beginning in $\ro^n$ and using the inverse $\inv{\psi}$ to go to $V\subseteq M$; then apply $\phi$ over the intersection $U\cap V$ to get back to $\ro^n.$ Thus we get</p>
$$\phi\circ\inv{\psi}:\psi(U\cap V)\rightarrow\phi(U\cap V)$$<p>Functions of this type are called <strong>transition functions</strong>. Intuitively, it means that we are begin with the region $\psi(U\cap V),$ which</p>

<p>General manifolds, as defined previously, are called <strong>topological manifolds</strong>, in contrast to those for which a smooth structure is given.</p>
<p>There are some topological manifolds which admit no smooth structure at all (eg, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kervaire_manifold">Kervaire</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E8_manifold">E8</a> manifolds), and some others that have different non-diffeomorphic smooth structures (like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_sphere">exotic spheres</a> found by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milnor">John Milnor</a>). The interaction between the purely topological and the smooth worlds is still an area of much research.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a stronger embedding theorem:</p>
<p><strong>Whitney embedding theorem</strong>: every $n$-dimensional smooth manifold can be embedded inside $\ro^{2n}.$</p>
<h3 id="topologies-on-cartesian-products">Topologies on cartesian products</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen above that many interesting spaces can be formed using cartesian products. These include boxes, the cylinder and torii, but also the space of strings $\mathcal{A}^n.$ We were able to topologize these either using the metric or subspace topologies, but what if we didn&rsquo;t have these? How to generally give a topology to the product of topological spaces?</p>
<p>Consider first the case of a product$X\times Y$ between two spaces $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y).$ A natural idea would be to define the topology</p>
$$\tau=\{U\times V\mid U\in \tau_X, V\in \tau_Y\},$$<p>i.e., open sets should be product of open sets in each coordinate. If $\pi_1:X\times Y\rightarrow X$ and $\pi_2:X\times Y\rightarrow Y$ are the corresponding projections onto the $n$-th coordinate (i.e., $\pi_1(x,y)=x$ and $\pi_2(x,y)=2$), then this topology is the minimal topology with $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ continuous. That is, the topology adds nothing beyond letting the projections be continuous, as intuitively they should be, as they represent collapsing a space to a specific coordinate.</p>
<p>When writing $U=\prod_{i\in I}U_i$ for an open set as above, the $U_i$ different from $X$ itself are for convenience called the <strong>non-trivial factors</strong> of $U.$</p>
<p>For general products $\prod X_i,$ we also want the minimal topology for which the projections $\pi_i$ are continuous. Thus, what we want is a basis made of sets $\inv{\pi_i}(U),$ for every $U$ open in $X_i.$ These sets are products with only non-trivial factor being $U$ in the $i$-th coordinate. Remembering then that a basis generates a topology by arbitrary unions and <em>finite</em> intersections, this basis produces the following topology:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: given a product $\prod_{i\in I} X_i$ of topological spaces $(X,\tau_i)_{i\in I},$ the <strong>product topology</strong> on $\prod_{i\in I} X_i$ is the topology whose open sets are of the form</p>
$$\{\prod_{i\in I}U_i\mid U_i \text{ is open in } X_i \text{, and only for finitely many } i \text{ we have }U_i\neq X_i\}$$<p>Quick reminder: the $I$ in $\prod_{i\in I} X_i$ is an <em>index set</em>, and can be any set you want. For finite products, it&rsquo;s just $\{1,...,n\}$ for some $n$; for infinite ones, it can be the whole natural numbers $\mathbb{N},$ the integers $\zo$ or anything you want!</p>
<p>If the spaces $X_i$ are homeomorphic to $Y_i,$ then the product $\prod X_i$ is homeomorphic to $\prod Y_i,$ by applying homeomorphisms on each coordinate.</p>
<p>If you leave the condition $U$ must have finitely many non-trivial factors and instead take only the topology $\{\prod_{i\in I}U_i\mid U_i \text{ is open in } X_i\},$ you&rsquo;ll get the so-called <strong>box topology</strong>, which is of interest for pure point-set topology, but not really for us in this series.</p>
<p>Now, if you topologize all the products we considered so far with this product topology, <strong>will it be the same space</strong>? I.e., is, for example, $\ro^n$ with the Euclidean topology the same as with the product one? <strong>Thankfully, the answer is yes, and so it is for every other product we&rsquo;ve met so far</strong>. Still, it is good to know how to define a topology for any product you want.</p>

<h3 id="gluing-spaces-quotients">Gluing spaces: quotients</h3>
<p>Topologically, the intuition of gluing points together of a space can be formalized using set equivalences. For example, imagine I have a segment of line (i.e., an interval) $I=[0,1]$ and I want to glue its endpoints to make a circle $S^1.$ Mathematically, all you need to know is to define an equivalence on $I$ such that $0\sim 1$ and all other points are equivalent only to themselves, getting a quotient $\quot{I}.$ Now the extremities are really one and the same thing.</p>

</figure>

<p>How do we topologize these spaces though? It&rsquo;s actually pretty simple: all we want is that the gluing function $q:X\rightarrow \quot{X}$ be continuous, which visually is quite sensible. This gives us the following:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: the <strong>quotient topology</strong> over $\quot{X}$ is the smallest topology such that $q:X\rightarrow \quot{X}$ is continuous. Equivalently, it is the topology of all $U\subseteq \quot{X}$ such that $\inv{q}(U)$ is open in $X.$</p>
<p>From the definition, you can see that, if $U$ is an open set $X$ such that its elements are equivalent only to themselves, then $q$ restricted to $U$ is a homeomorphism: i.e., $U$ is not altered in the quotient topology.</p>
<p>Generally, if you have a space $X$ and a subspace $A\subseteq X,$ you can collapse $A$ onto a single point using the relation $\sim_A$ such that $a\sim_A b$ for all $a,b\in A$ and all other points of $X$ are equivalent only to themselves. In this case, we don&rsquo;t write $X/{\sim_A},$ but rather $X/A,$ a space often called the <strong>quotient of</strong> $X$ <strong>by</strong> $A.$</p>
<p>In this notation, the homeomorphism $\quot{I}\cong S^1$ is the same as $I/\{0,1\}\cong S^1.$ It can now be formally proven: indeed, the function $f:I/\{0,1\}\rightarrow S^1$ is given by $f([t])=(\cos(t),\sin(t))$ (seeing $S^1$ embedded in $\ro^2$) is a homeomorphism. It is well-defined because we have $f([0])=f([1]),$ and bijective too. You can prove that it and its inverse are both continuous.</p>
<p>The case of $I$ and $S^1$ can be generalized by noting that $I=D^1$ and $\{0,1\}=S^0.$ One dimension higher, if you have $D^2$ and glue its whole $S^1$ boundary onto a single point, you get a sphere $S^2.$ Thus, $D^2/S^1\cong S^2,$ and in general we have $D^n/S^{n-1}\cong S^n$ (you can try proving this). Cool: we&rsquo;re starting to do some algebra with spaces!</p>
<p>IMG!!!! D2/S1</p>
<p>The notation is suggestive: it&rsquo;s almost as if we were dividing $X$ by a $A$&ndash; imagining $A$ as a &ldquo;factor&rdquo; of $X.$ But &ldquo;suggestive&rdquo; is the best we can say, as it actually doesn&rsquo;t really follow algebraic rules like division. There&rsquo;s also somewhat of a shock of notations here: if $0$ denotes a generic point in $X,$ then $X/0$ is really, by definition, homeomorphic to $X$ itself: $X/0\cong X.$</p>
<p>For simpler quotients, open sets in $\quot{X}$ can be easily visualized. It is as if the glued regions worked as &ldquo;portals&rdquo; open sets can now tranverse.</p>

<p>One common kind of quotients are <strong>wedge sums</strong>, which consist of joining different spaces on a single point. Formally, the wedge sum between spaces $X$ and $Y$, written $X\vee Y,$ is the quotient $\quot{X\amalg Y}$ with the relation $x_0\sim y_0$ for two fixed points $x_0\in X$ and $y_0\in Y.$ You can prove that different choices of $x_0, y_0$ give homeomorphic spaces, so that we&rsquo;re allowed to speak of <strong>the</strong> wedge sum $X\vee Y.$</p>

<p>Generally, if you have two distinct spaces $X$ and $Y$ and you want to glue points $x$ of $X,$ all lying in a specified subspace $A\subseteq X,$ to points $g(x)$ in $Y$ (with $g:A\rightarrow Y$ any function), then all you need is to take the relation $\sim$ in $X\amalg Y$ with $x\sim g(x).$ The quotient $\quot{X\amalg Y}$ then will represent the spaces glued together at the specified points.</p>

<p>In the article on homology, we&rsquo;ll further describe many spaces as quotients.</p>
<h2 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h2>
<p>If topology gives us a notion of proximity, can it define a notion of connectivity of a space? Take the example of the union of the intervals $(0,1)$ and $(2,3)$ in $\ro.$ Intuitively, their union forms a disconnected subspace. One might then be tempted to say that this is because they&rsquo;re disjoint, and we&rsquo;re done. But then consider $(0,1)$ and $\{0,1\}$&ndash; i.e., $(0,1)$ and its boundary. These are disjoint sets, but their union forms the interval $[0,1],$ which feels connected, and so mere set theoretical disjointness can&rsquo;t explain the intuition of connectivity.</p>
<p>What pure set theory lacks is the notion, as we saw above, of addherent points. Sure, $(0,1)$ and $\{0,1\}$ are disconnected, but the later are addherent to the first. The points $0$ and $1$ can&rsquo;t really be separated from the interval $(0,1)$&ndash; they&rsquo;re &ldquo;connected&rdquo; to it. This leads us to say that a space $X$ should be disconnected if there are disjoint subsets sets $A,B$ covering it, with $A$ and $B$ sharing no addherence relation&ndash; i.e., no point in one is addherent to the other.</p>
<p>This implies $A$ and $B$ above are closed: if $x$ is addherent to $A,$ it must be in $A$ or else it would contradictorily be in $B$&ndash; and similarly for addherent points of $B.$ But then $A$ and $B$ are also open, since $A=X\setminus B$ and $B$ is closed- and similarly for $B.$ In particular, $A$ and $B$ are <strong>clopen sets!</strong> This leads us to the more common definition of connectivity:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a topological space $X$ is called <strong>connected</strong> if there are no disjont open sets $U,V$ such that $U\cup V = X.$ Otherwise, it is said to be <strong>disconnected</strong>, and we&rsquo;ll say $U$ and $V$ separate $X.$</p>
<p>You can check that, if $U,V$ separate $X,$ they must be clopen.</p>
<p>The largest connected subset containing a point $x\in X$ is said to be its <strong>connected component</strong>. Any space can be divided into connected components.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see that connectivity is a <strong>topological invariant</strong>. Indeed, if $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous and $X$ connected, then $f(X)$ is also connected; otherwise, if it could be divided into two disjoint open sets $U,V$ in $\im f,$ then $\inv{f}(U)$ and $\inv{f}(V)$ would be open, disjoint (there can be no $x\in \inv{f}(U)\cap \inv{f}(V)$ since it would imply $f(x)\in U\cap V$) and cover $X$, a contradiction. In particular, homeomorphic have the same connectivity, in the sense that they have homeomorphic connected components.</p>
<p>An important theorem is that intervals in $\ro$ (and in any order topology too) are connected. This must be proven, but we&rsquo;ll not do that here&ndash; you check Munkres for it. This can then in its turn be used to prove that the entire line $\ro$ is connected, by using the result (a good exercise) that, if $A,B$ are connected subspaces of a space $X$ with non-empty intersection, $A\cup B$ is connected. Since $\ro$ can be seen as a chain of open intervals&ndash; as $\bigcup_{n\in \zo} (n-1, n+1),$ for example&ndash;, then the line must be connected.</p>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>Take this together with the last proposition and you almost immediately get an important theorem from calculus:</p>
<p><strong>Intermediate value theorem</strong>: if a continuous function $f:X\rightarrow \ro$ from a connected space $X$ obtains values $a$ and $b,$ with $a< b,$ then there must exist a $x\in X$ obtaining an intermediate value: $a < f(x) < b.$</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>: The proof is by contradiction. Suppose there were $x_1,x_2\in X$ with $f(x_1)< f(x_2),$ and that there is some real number $c$ such that $f(x_1)< c<  f(x_2)$ but no $x\in X$ with $f(x)=c.$ But then we have $\inv{f}(\ro)$ as the union of two disjoint open sets</p>
$$\inv{f}(U)=\inv{f}(-\infty, c)\cup \inv{f}(c, \infty)$$<p>Thus, $\inv{f}(U)=X$ is disconnected, which contradicts our hypothesis.</p>
<div style="text-align: right;">\(\blacksquare\)</div>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>For example, we can prove the following theorem&ndash; whose generalization to any dimension will be a topological result of extreme importance with interesting applications to the study of games and game theory:</p>
<p><strong>One-dimensional Brouwer fixed point theorem</strong>: a continuous function $f:[0,1]\rightarrow[0,1]$ has at least one fixed point&ndash; i.e., a point $x$ such that $f(x)=x.$</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>: we can visualize the theorem as stating that for any such continuous function $f,$ its graph must intersect the (positive) diagonal of the square $[0,1]^2.$</p>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>Suppose by contradiction, that $f$ has no fixed point, thus its graph not intersecting the diagonal. If there are $x,y$ such that $f(x)>x$ and $f(y)< y,$ the intermediate value theorem would imply some $z$ with $f(z)=z,$ so suppose, say, that $f(x)>x$ for all $x\in[0,1].$ Then $1\geq f(x)>x$ for all $x,$ which can&rsquo;t be true for $x=1.$ Similarly, assuming $f(x)< x$ would also lead to a contradiction. Thus $f$ must have a fixed point.</p>
<div style="text-align: right;">\(\blacksquare\)</div>
<p>Furthermore, any product of connected spaces is connected as well. Every quotient of a connected space is also connected. Both proofs are quite simple and work by assuming disconnectedness and then finding a contradiction with the connectivity of the original spaces.</p>
<p>Connectivity can be used to prove some spaces aren&rsquo;t homeomorphic. The classical example is that of $\ro$ and $\ro^n,$ for $n>1.$ For, if you take the origin away from the line, you get a disconnected space with two components: $(-\infty,0)$ and $(0,\infty).$ But if you do the same for any other $\ro^n,$ $n>1,$ you still get a connected space. Thus these two can&rsquo;t be homeomorphic. You can use a similar trick to prove that branched spaces aren&rsquo;t manifolds.</p>
<p>Beyond this notion of connectivity purely based on sets, there&rsquo;s another intuitive one: visually, we think of connected figures as those in which every two points can be connected by a line. Thus we get the following definition:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a topological space $X$ is called <strong>path-connected</strong> if, for every two points $x,y\in X,$ there&rsquo;s a path $p:I\rightarrow X$ starting in $x$ and ending in $y$ (i.e., $p(0)=x$ and $p(1)=y$).</p>
<p>Similarly to connected components, spaces also have path-connected components.</p>
<p>Path-connectedness is also a topological property. Indeed, if $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous and $X$ path-connected, so is $\im y$: if $f(x),f(y)$ are in $\im f,$ $x$ and $y$ can be connected by a path $p$ in $X,$ and so $f\circ p:I\rightarrow \im f$ connects $f(x)$ to $f(y).$ Thus:</p>
<p><strong>Proposition</strong>: continuous functions preserve path-connectivy between their domains and images.</p>
<p>Path-connectedness implies connectedness: for if $X$ were path-connected but had $U,V$ separating it, then if $p$ is a path connecting $u\in U$ and $v\in V,$ $\inv{p}(U)$ and $\inv{p}(V)$ will be disjoint open sets covering $I,$ which is absurd.</p>
<p>Is the converse true&ndash; i.e., are all connected spaces path-connected. The answer is negative. The classical example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topologist%27s_sine_curve">topologist&rsquo;s sine curve</a>, which is the subspace of $\ro^2$ formed by the graph of the curve $f(x)=\sin (\frac{1}{x})$ (with $x\in (0,1]$) joined with the origin.</p>
<p>IMG !!!!</p>
<p>The topologist&rsquo;s sine curve is connected, since the graph of $f$ is connected and the origin is addherent to it. But there&rsquo;s no continuous path connecting a point in the graph to the origin. Try to make visualize it and make this is somewhat intuitive&ndash; proving it is a bit tedious so we won&rsquo;t do it here.</p>
<h2 id="homotopy">Homotopy</h2>
<h3 id="paths-and-holes">Paths and holes</h3>
<p>Beyond homeomorphisms, there&rsquo;s another notion of equivalence between spaces: <strong>homotopy</strong>. <strong>We say two spaces are &ldquo;homotopical&rdquo; when you can continuously transform one into the other over time</strong>.</p>
<p>A circle and a square should be seen as homotopical since one can be transformed into the other in a continuous process. But this notion is even stronger: a disk and a point are homotopical since you can continuously shrink the disk in time until you get a single point (say its center). But you intuitively shouldn&rsquo;t be able to modify a disk into its boundary circle in this way.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you take the center point of the disk, this can be done by pushing points towards the boundary along a radial line. Similarly, a cylinder and a circle should be homotopical since you can flatten the first into the later&ndash; but still preserving the hole in the middle. These are good indications that the notion of homotopy might be a good notion to identify holes: let&rsquo;s formalize it!</p>
<p>IMG!!! IBAAAAAAAAAGENS</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with the simplest case: that of a paths in our space $X,$ which can be used as probes to explore the topology of $X.$ Begin with two paths $p,q.$ To say we can &ldquo;continuously transform&rdquo; path $p$ into $q$ means that, for a time value $t$ in the range $[0,1],$ we have a path $p_t,$ representing the transformation at $t,$ with $p_0=p$ and $p_1=q,$ so as to begin with $p$ and end with $q.$</p>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>How can we actually tell if these $p_t$ evolve &ldquo;continuily&rdquo;? This can be done by writting the process as a function $H:I\times I\rightarrow X,$ with $H(s,t)$ equal to $p_t(s)$&ndash; i.e., the first coordinate is spacial, the second temporal. We should then have $H(s,0)=f(s)$ and $H(s, 1) = g(s)$. If $H$ is continuous we then say the transformation is too as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we have:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a <strong>homotopy</strong> between two paths $f:I\rightarrow X$ and $g:I\rightarrow X$ in a space $X$ is a continuous association of paths $p_t$ for every $t\in I$ such that $p_0=f$ and $p_1=g.$ More formally, it is a continuous function $H:I\times I\rightarrow X$ such that $H(s,0)=f(s)$ and $H(s,1)=g(s).$ When $f$ and $g$ are <strong>homotopic</strong> (i.e., there&rsquo;s a homotopy between them), we write $f\simeq g.$</p>
<p>Homotopy is a sort of &ldquo;path between paths&rdquo;, so to speak. You can check that it is an equivalence relation between paths in $X$: that is, $p\simeq p$ for all paths $p$; $p\simeq q$ implies $q\simeq p$; and, most importantly, $p\simeq q$ and $q\simeq r$ implies $p\simeq r$ (i.e., homotopy of paths is transitive). The set of the equivalence class of this relation is written as $[I,X].$</p>
<p>It is a further indicative of the importance of homotopy that $[I,X]$ is fundamentally related to the connectivity of $X.$ See, if we have paths $p$ and $q$ lying on the same path-connected component of $X,$ then they&rsquo;re homotopic: for if $r$ is a path between the end of $p$ and the beginning of $q,$ then the path $p$ can be brought to $q$ along $r.$ More explicitly, if $f:I\rightarrow X$ is the path which travels through $p,$ then $r$ and $q,$</p>
$$f(x)=
\begin{cases}
p(3x), & \text{if } 0\leq x\leq \frac{1}{3} \\
r(3x), & \text{if } \frac{1}{3} \leq x\leq \frac{2}{3}\\
q(3x), & \text{if } \frac{2}{3}\leq x\leq 1
\end{cases}
$$<p>then a homotopy between $p$ and $q$ is given by $H(x,t)=f(\frac{x}{3} + \frac{2t}{3})$&ndash; i.e., $H$ slides $p$ into $q$ along $f$ along time $t.$</p>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>Conversely, if paths $p$ and $q$ are homotopic, then for each point $x\in I,$ $H(x,t)$ is a path from $p(s)$ to $q(s),$  so that all points in both paths being in the same path-componnent. <strong>Thus the elements of</strong> $[I,X]$ <strong>represent exactly the path-connected components of</strong> $X,$ with the class $[p]$ being associated to the path-componnent of path $p.$</p>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>There are many variations of path homotopy. For example, we can also consider homotopy with <strong>fixed endings</strong>&ndash; i.e., where we require that all paths have the same end points. This means enforcing extra conditions $p_t(0)=x_1$ and $p_t(1)=x_2$ for all $t.$ This homotopy is also an equivalence relation, and its set of equivalence classes is written $[(I,0,1), (X,x_1,x_2)].$</p>
<p>What the notation $[(I,0,1), (X,x_1,x_2)]$ means is that we restrict ourselves to maps and homotopies seding $0$ to $x_1$ and $1$ to $x_2.$ In general, if you have subspaces $A_i\subseteq I,$ and $B_i\subseteq X,$ then you have a set of classes $[(I, A_1, A_2,...), (X, B_1, B_2,...)].$ Each class is represented by paths $p:I\rightarrow X$ such that $p(A_i)\subseteq B_i$ and the equivalence is given by homotopies of the form $H:I\times I\rightarrow X$ such that each path $H(x,t)$ for $x$ fixed is of the desired type of paths (i.e., those sending $A_i$ to $B_i$). These general homotopies will be handy later on.</p>
<p>Note that $[(I,0,1), (X,x_1,x_2)]$ considers only paths beginning in $x_1$ and ending in $x_2,$ and if we wanted to include those with reverted end points we should then use $[(I,\{0,1\}), (X, \{x_1,x_2\})].$</p>
<p>A particularly important set of homotopy classes is $[(I,\{0,1\}), (X, x_0)],$ as it represents <strong>homotopy of loops</strong> at a chosen point $x_0$&ndash; i.e., of paths $p$ with $p(0)=p(1)=x_0,$ and homotopies fixing this point $x_0.$</p>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>One of the main uses of path homotopy is to use paths as probes with each you can explore your. Beyond $[I,X]$ and its relation to path-connectivity, loop homotopy is fundamental because of the two following intuitive considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take the space $X,$ which is $D^2$ with a smaller disk taken away from it, and let&rsquo;s consider homotopy of loops in it. Some loops don&rsquo;t go around the empty middle region. These can be slowly shrunk until they&rsquo;re the constant paths $p(x)=x_0,$ for all $x\in I$&ndash; i.e., the paths can be shrunk to the single point $x_0.$ However, some loops do go aroung the &ldquo;hole&rdquo; left over, and, intuitively, these can&rsquo;t be homotoped to $x_0.$ These are &ldquo;detecting&rdquo; the hole, so to speak, and are a loop homotopy class different from those that don&rsquo;t go around it;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take the same $X$ as above. It doesn&rsquo;t matter only if a loop goes around the hole, but <strong>how many times</strong> it goes around. Intuitively, this should homotopically distinguish loops too. Orientation matters too: a loop goin clockwise around the hole can&rsquo;t really be homotoped to one goind counter-clockwise, i.e., with the inverted direction. Thus, it seems like, if $a$ denotes a loop on the counter-clockwise direction going around the hole a single time, then all other loops can be classified as $a^n,$ $n$ indicating how many times it goes around the hole (negative values indicating the opposite direction). We&rsquo;ll prove this properly on another article;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<ul>
<li>Now, take $Y$ as $D^2$ with <em>two</em> holes. Loops around a single one of these holes can&rsquo;t be contracted, so we have two base loop $a$ and $b$&ndash; one going around each hole, a single time and in counter-clockwise direction. If you keep playing with the homotopy classes of holes in $Y,$ you&rsquo;ll find that these seem to be classified by (finite) strings involving $a$ and $b,$ indicating the order of holes the loop goes around. Here are some samples from this loop-zoo:</li>
</ul>
<p>This all indicates that $[(I,\{0,1\}), (X, x_0)]$ is able to detect holes in a space $X$; further, it distinguishes the amount of times a loop goes around a hole. These are indicatives of an underlying algebraic structure, and, indeed, we can properly define how to &ldquo;join&rdquo; two loops together, getting an operation that makes $[(I,\{0,1\}), (X, x_0)]$ an algebraic structure called a <strong>group</strong>. This is called the <strong>fundamental group</strong> of $X,$ written $\pi_1(X),$ and we&rsquo;ll properly study it later on in this series. By the previous remarks, it seems that the fundamental group of $X$ is $\zo$ and that of $Y$ is the free group on two generators, $F_2$&ndash; which is indeed correct, as we&rsquo;ll see in the future.</p>
<p>Homotopy of paths seemed to be a very powerful tool to study spaces. Let&rsquo;s generalize it!</p>
<h3 id="general-homotopy">General homotopy</h3>
<p>Homotopy of paths was great, but remember our initial motivation of homotopy as a notion of equivalence between spaces&ndash; not only paths&ndash;, much like homeomorphisms.´</p>
<p>Thankfully, the general definitions are almost immediate now. Substituting paths by any sort of mapping from a space $X$ to another one $Y,$ we get</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a <strong>homotopy</strong> between two continuous maps $f:X\rightarrow Y$ and $g:X\rightarrow Y$ is a continuous function $H:X\times I\rightarrow Y$ such that $H(x, 0)=f(x)$ and $H(x,1)=g(1)$.</p>
<p>IMG</p>
<p>Similarly to above, homotopy is an equivalence relation, detoned $\simeq$ as well, with the spaces being understood in context. We denote the set of its classes as $[X,Y],$ and we may generalize as above to get $[(X,A_1,A_2,...), (Y,B_1,B_2,...)].$ These are called <strong>homotopies of tuples</strong>, and we showed above how useful they can be.</p>
<p>Note, for example, that $[(I,\{0,1\}), (X, x_0)]$ is fundamentally the same thing as $[(S^1, p), (X, x_0)],$ with $p$ some fixed point of the circle, since the endpoints $\{0,1\}$ of $I$ are fundamentally glued together as they&rsquo;re both sent to $x_0.$</p>
<p>Now, for each $X$ and $Y,$ $[X,Y]$ is a whole world of topology&ndash; usually a very difficult one to completely specify. Indeed, most branches of (algebraic) topology can be seen as the study of some $[X,Y],$ for specific $X,Y.$ This includes homotopy groups, homology, cohomology, cobordism and many other interesting theories we&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to study in this series. Describing a topological theory as the study of some $[X,Y]$ is one of the tasks of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(topology)">spectra theory</a>, a branch of algebraic topology probably way beyond anything we&rsquo;ll actually see in Topology for Artists.</p>
<p>Homotopic functions can be substituted without any worries in equations using the relation $\simeq$: i.e., if $f\simeq g,$ then $f\circ h\simeq g\circ h$ and $h \circ f\simeq h \circ g.$ For if $H:X\times I\rightarrow Y$ is a homotopy between $f$ and $g$ and $h:Z\rightarrow X$ any continuous map, then $H':Z\times I\rightarrow I$ with $H'(z,t)=H(h(z),t)$ is a homotopy between $f\circ h\simeq g\circ h,$ and similarly can be proven for the other substitution case.</p>
<p>Anyway, now that we know how to describe general homotopies, we can now properly define when two $X,Y$ spaces are &ldquo;homotopically equivalent&rdquo;. This can be used in analogy to homeomorphisms: a continuous function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a homeomorphism if there&rsquo;s another continuous function $g:Y\rightarrow X$ (the inverse of $f,$ written $\inv{f}$) such that $f\circ g = \text{id}_X$ and $g\circ f = \text{id}_Y.$ For homotopy, instead of asking for equality $=$, we can instead ask just for the homotopy relation $\simeq.$ That is, we define</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: two spaces $X,Y$ are <strong>homotopically equivalent</strong> if there are continuous functions $f:X\rightarrow Y$ and $g:Y\rightarrow X$ such that $f\circ g \simeq \text{id}_Y$ and $g\circ f \simeq \text{id}_X.$ We may also say that $X$ and $Y$ have the same <strong>homotopy type</strong>, and write $X\simeq Y.$</p>
<p>What this means is that you don&rsquo;t need to properly find an inverse for $f,$ but anything homotopically equivalent to an inverse&ndash; so that $g$ above is often called the <strong>homotopy inverse</strong> of $f.$</p>
<p>You can check that the given definitions are equivalent and that homotopy equivalence is, indeed, an equivalence relation between topological spaces.</p>
<p>Another reason why this is a good definition is that, if $X,Y$ are homotopically equivalent, then $[Z,X]$ and $[Z,Y]$ stand in one-to-one correspondence, for any $Z.$ This is the case because if we define $f':[Z,X]\rightarrow [Z,Y]$ with $f'([h])=[f\circ h],$ this is well-defined and has inverse $g':[Z,Y]\rightarrow [Z,X]$ with $g'([h])=[g\circ h],$ once</p>
$$g\circ(f\circ h)\simeq \text{id}_X\circ h=h,$$<p>so that $g'(f'([h]))=[h],$ thus $f'$ being a bijection between $[Z,X]$ and $[Z,Y].$</p>
<p>Similarly can be shown for $[X,Z]$ and $[Y,Z],$ for any $Z,$ and for homotopies of tuples as well. That is, $f$ and $g$ giving a homotopy equivalence $X\simeq Y$ are fundamentally the same thing as continuous functions inducing bijections on sets of homotopy equivalence classes, so that anything that can be said of (any kind of!) homotopies in $X$ can be said for $Y.$</p>
<p>Here are some homotopy equivalences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All homeomorphisms $f$ are homotpy equivalences by just taking $f$ and its inverse;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reals $\ro^n$ are equivalent to a point $\{p\}$. Explicitly, for $f:\ro^n\rightarrow \{p\},$ it has a homotopical inverse $g:\{p\}\rightarrow \ro^n$ given by $g(p)=0,$ the inclusion of $p$ as the originl. The homotopy is $H(x,t)=tx$&ndash; i.e., all elements are bringed to the origin along a line, homotopying $\ro^n$ into the origin. There&rsquo;s no hole or other topological obstruction not allowing you to continually collapse the whole space into a single point. The exact same can be said of $D^2.$ In general, spaces with the homotopy type of a point are called <strong>contractible</strong>. Open balls in $\ro^n$ are also contractible;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$D^n$ and $S^n$ aren&rsquo;t equivalent, due to $S^n$ having a hole in the middle. We&rsquo;ll prove this properly later;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A very important kind of functions, both for intuition and for formalities, is that of retractions. Formally, a <strong>retraction</strong> from a space $X$ to a subspace $A\subseteq X$ is a continuous functions $r:X\rightarrow A$ such that $r(a)=a$ for all $a\in A.$ That is, we leave $A$ alone and send the rest of $X$ to it. A <strong>deformation retract</strong> is a deformation $r$ which is homotopical to the idenitity in $X.$ Together with the inclusion $i:A\rightarrow X,$ a deformation retract gives an equivalence between $X$ and $A,$ so that $A$ is a potentially smaller and simpler subspace, but homotopically identical to the original $X.$</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<ul>
<li>A very important theorem (not hard, but tedious to prove) is that <strong>contracting contractible subspaces preserves homotopy type</strong>. That is, if $A\subseteq X$ is contractible, then $X/A\simeq X.$ For example, $S^1\vee S^1$ has the same type as the space $X$ formed by two copies of $S^1$ connected by a segment $I,$ since the later is contractible. Note, however, that these two spaces aren&rsquo;t homeomorphic, in particular because only $S^1\vee S^1$ has a point with a neighborhood with four branches (an &ldquo;X&rdquo; shape), and only $X$ has points with a neighborhood with three branches (an &ldquo;Y&rdquo; shape).</li>
</ul>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<ul>
<li>We can use these facts to homotopically classify the English alphabet. Take the capital letters and topologically consider them as surfaces with boundaries. We can deformation retract them to their &ldquo;thin&rdquo; versions, getting 1D branched figures. One can further simplify these figures by contracting contractible subspaces, e.g. the two legs in &ldquo;A&rdquo; in order to get a triangle&ndash; topologically, a circle $S^1.$ This allows for a complete homotopical classification of all letters, with the amount of holes being the deciding property: &ldquo;B&rdquo; has two holes and is equivalent to $S^1\vee S^1;$ &ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;R&rdquo;, &ldquo;D&rdquo;, &ldquo;O&rdquo;, &ldquo;P&rdquo; and &ldquo;Q&rdquo; are equivalent to $S^1;$ all other letters have no holes and are equivalent to a single point. Note that the original spaces and their deformation retracts are homotopically equivalent, but not homeomorphic, since, in particular, they have different dimensions.</li>

<p>Note above that, in the definition of homotopy of funtions, we did not ask for $f$ to be an embedding&ndash; it could be full of self-intersections and other singularities. What if we didn&rsquo;t allow that, and require that homotopy be done without gluing any pieces of our space together or doing anything else to change its topology? This is called isotopy, and the definition is an immediate generalization of homotopy:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: an <strong>isotopy</strong> between two embeddings $f:X\rightarrow Y$ and $g:X\rightarrow Y$ is a continuous function $H:X\times I\rightarrow Y$ such that $H(x,0)=f(x),$ $H(x,1)=g(x)$ and, for every fixed $t$, $H(\cdot, t):X\rightarrow Y$ is a homeomorphism.</p>
<p>IMG!!! caminhos, espaços gerais</p>
<p>Note that, while homotopy is an invariant of a single space $X,$ isotopy is an invariant of two spaces $X$ and $Y$&ndash; more properly, an invariant relation between the two. $X$ might have one isotopy behaviour inside $Y$ and a completely different one in $Z,$ so that actually isotopy is not a property <em>of a space</em>, but rather <em>between spaces</em>.</p>
<p>An example of the difference between homotopy and isotopy can be shown with two paths $p, q$ in $I$: $p(x)=x$ traverses $I$ from left to right, $q(x)=1-x$ going in the opposite direction. These are homotopical paths, for example with the homotopy $H(x,t)=x+t-2xt,$ which progressively linearly flips $p$ into $q.$ This flipping, however, can&rsquo;t be done in any way without eventually collapsing the path into a single point&ndash; only then to invert its direction. At this singularity (happening for example at $t=\frac{1}{2}$ in the given homotopy), we&rsquo;re not &ldquo;homotopying&rdquo; with embeddings. Thus the paths $p$ and $q$ are homotopic, but surely not isotopic.</p>
<p>The most common and intuitive application of isotopy&ndash; one we use day to day and have engraved in our spatial perception of the world&ndash; are knots. Mathematically, knots are seen as embeddings of the circle:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a <strong>knot</strong> is an embedding of $S^1$ in some space, generally taken to be $\ro^3.$ Two knots are said to be the same if they are isotopic.</p>
<p>All knots are homotopic to one another as paths, but, since this would require self-intersections, not necessarily isotopic!</p>
<p>Note that this definition considers only knots with their ends joined&ndash; those with free ends are all isotopic to the segment $I,$ so not much can be topologically said without gluing ends.</p>
<p>We generally study knots by planar figures of them. The least amount of crossings such a figure for a knot has is called the <strong>crossing number</strong> of the knot.</p>
<p>IMG!!! Knot 3D E FIGURA</p>
<p>Knot theory is a vast area of topology and still actively researched. Its main goals, fundamentally, are to classificate all knots, and tell whenever two arbitrary knots are equivalent or not. This might be done using &ldquo;knot invariants&rdquo;, which are quantities or properties that don&rsquo;t change with isotopies and may help us distinguishing knots. Still, both tasks are insanely difficult and probably will never be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a table of knots with small crossing numbers:</p>
<p>IMG!!! KNOT TABLE, KNOT ATLAS</p>
<p>Knot theory is a beautiful area of study, specially because many of the invariant aren&rsquo;t actually hard to compute&ndash; even though finding and proving they&rsquo;re invariant might be. In the early and mid 20th century, it was developed as an application of algebraic topology and a challenge to its concepts. Later in the century, deep and fascinating relations between knots and physics&ndash; specially statistical mechanics and quantum field theory&ndash; were found, leading to major breakthroughs in knot theory. New invariants were found and interpreted as invariant properties of certain physical systems&ndash; like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model">Ising model</a>, a simplified model of magnets.</p>
<p>Knots, in general, are just fascinating per se. They have a certain &ldquo;thingness&rdquo; to them: each knot is an object by itself, and there&rsquo;s a pleasure in studying each of them&ndash; like a collection of some sort. Unlike collections of plants, insects or whatever it be, a single knot can take a multitude of appearances, so that you never know if a complicated knot might actually be an old friend in disguise. The generation principle of this multitude is isotopy in 3D space, but also the vast combinatorial possibilities of how to slide strings into holes. Their local simplicity makes them even more interesting: they&rsquo;re just lines, 1D spaces. They&rsquo;re &ldquo;thin&rdquo;, &ldquo;topologico-combinatorial&rdquo; &ldquo;things&rdquo;, if we want to describe the &ldquo;phenomenology&rdquo; of knots.</p>
<p>Despite the incredible richness of this mathematical theory, it would be a great pity to limit oneself to the theoretical world. One principle of this series is that we should remain curious to all aspects of a thing. And then we reach a truly infinite branch of human activity when we study knots in the real world&ndash; their use in the naval world, in fabrics, hitching, heraldry and semiotics, and much, much more. A more careful exposition of both the mathematical and practical sides will be given when we study homotopy further, in a dedicated post.</p>

<p>The classical encyclopedic reference on knots in the real world is <strong>The Ashley Book of Knots</strong>, a magnificent work with almost four thousand entries and seven thousand illustrations. The author, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Warren_Ashley">Clifford W. Ashley</a>, can be described as a kind of <em>knot-romantic</em>&ndash; or <em>knot-reactionary</em>, as these two often come together. I hope it won&rsquo;t bore the reader if we analyse a little of his curious introduction to the Book of Knots.</p>
<p>Since the book is already copyright-free, <a href="/pdfs/ashley.pdf">here&rsquo;s a pdf for you</a>.</p>
<p>Ashley begins by affirming his main devotion to naval knots, whose importance, one must admit, is probably unsurpassed by any other application. Still, this is representative for how he highlights the dignity of knots as coming from the human universal of tying them, at the same time not without internally differentiating the same universality:</p>
<blockquote class="md-hint normal">
<p><em>The sailor, from the very nature of his craft, has a dependence upon rope and a consequent familiarity with knots that is demanded of no other workman. It follows that most important knots owe both their origin and their names to the requirements of a ship at sea. So diverse are these requirements that the number of knots devised by the sailor is probably ten times greater than the sum of all other handicrafts combined. Nor is this surprising if we consider that on a full-rigged ship, in everyday use, are several miles of rigging, and an able seaman, of necessity, is acquainted with every inch of this extent.</em></p>
<p><em>Knotting has been an important adjunct to the everyday life of all people from the earliest days of which we have knowledge. There are still primitive races who fasten their huts, traps, canoes, and harness with knotted thongs and withes. But civilized man is no less dependent on knots than his more backward brothers, even though knots today are much less in evidence in sophisticated surroundings.</em></p>
<p><em>Long ago man recognized the decorative possibilities of knots, and “fancy knotting” is one of the oldest and most widely distributed of the folk arts. But it remained for the sailor to seize upon this art and to develop it into something that is peculiarly his own.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a later passager, he also praises the internationalism of knots, but not refraining from letting evident some anglophone pride:</p>
<blockquote class="md-hint normal">
<p><em>Very little nationalism is evident among knots. One reason for this may be that the merchant sailor has never been too particular about what flag he sailed under, and in the general shifting about, knots soon became common property. Here and there we have a “Spanish,” “Portuguese,” “English,” “French,” or “American” Knot, but seldom is the application of such a name at all universal. The same knot may be attributed to several countries, just as Flat “Over-One-and-Under-One” Sinnet (#2976) is called by English-speaking sailors “French Sinnet” and by the ever-polite French “Tresse Anglaise.”</em></p>
<p><em>It is impossible to make a distinction between the British and the American contribution to knots. There were English sailors in every Yankee forecastle. But it would seem that English-speaking people as a whole have made the largest single contribution to the subject. At the present time Scandinavian sailors are doing more toward preserving the traditions of marlingspike seamanship than any other seamen.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, in a platonic move (Plato would&rsquo;ve loved knot theory), Ashley clearly interprets the introduction of new media in the sea life as a necessary opponent to knot-tying:</p>
<blockquote class="md-hint normal">
<p><em>Usually the advent of steam is held accountable for putting a period to the art of knottin. But the facts that a sailor could not read an ad the same time employ his hands may be acceptes as in great part responsible.</em></p>
<p><em>(&hellip;)</em></p>
<p><em>It was inevitable that when the sailor learned to read he would neglect the arts. Eventually good marlingspike sailors became scarce. Only the essential everyday knots were taught to the greenhorns in the forecastle, and work that formerly had been done at sea was turned out in the rigging loft.</em></p>
<p><em>Abruptly, however, in the second quarter of the twentieeth century, knotting began to pick up again, and sailors the world over evinced a renewed interest. To the casual observer this might have seemd to be a fabricated or even a sentimental phenomenon. Yet on turbine and Diesel ships, on gasoline boats and piano-wired yachts, fancy knots were again in evidence.</em></p>
<p><em>(&hellip;)</em></p>
<p><em>This I hold to be real progress; and the sailor today is a far happier mortal than ever he was before. Something of course is missing, for gone are the tall ships of yesterday, but somewhere in the offing may be something else quite as beautiful.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, just beyond the horizon is the threat of the cinema and television, which require only a little popularizing cheapness before they too will invade the forecastle; when they do the sailor&rsquo;s hands will again be idle.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite contradictions and a certain stiff predominance of naval knots, Ashley&rsquo;s knot-romanticism still had its place, and one may wonder how far a knot-obsession can lead a man:</p>
<blockquote class="md-hint normal">
<p><em>From that day I have continued to collect knots wherever I could find them, and as unfamiliar sailors’ knots became increasingly difficult to find I was attracted by the knots of other occupations. I hobnobbed with butchers and steeple jacks, cobblers and truck drivers, electric linesmen, Boy Scouts, and with elderly ladies who knit. Mr. Ringling himself, I cannot recall now which of the several brothers it was, took me about his circus and was pleased to be able to dazzle me with a score of knots with which I was quite unfamiliar. It was pleasant to talk to a brother showman again, and the meeting was not one bit too soon, for almost overnight the interior of the circus tent became a spiderweb of wire and turnbuckles instead of hemp and blocks.</em></p>
<p><em>Will James, “the Lone Cowboy,” showed me the THEODORE KNOT one day while we were lunching with Joseph Chapin, then the Art Editor of Scribner’s Magazine. In Boston I halted an operation to see how the surgeon made fast his stitches. I have watched oxen slung for the shoeing, I have helped throw pack lashings, I have followed tree surgeons through their acrobatics and examined poachers’ traps and snares. But I never saw Houdini, never was present at a successful lynching, and never participated in a commercial second-story venture.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>IMGS!!! ANIMAIS NO ASHLEY.</p>
<p>Back to the math, remind yourself that isotopy is about the relation between spaces, and not spaces themselves. This is made clear by a classical theorem proved by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein">Klein</a>, stating that all knots embedded in $\ro^4$ are isotopic to the unknot&ndash; i.e., they can all be untied in 4D space. The extra dimension is what allows you to do that: this is similar to how we can &ldquo;free&rdquo; a shape contained into another in the plane by lifting it in 3D space and then putting it back in the plane, but outside the other figure.</p>
<p>IMG!! OU GIF!!</p>
<p>The fact that there are no knots in 4D space, and seemingly the whole mathematical theory of knots, were seen by our beloved knot-romantic/reactionary with a slight contempt:</p>
<blockquote class="md-hint normal">
<p><em>To me the simple act of tying a knot is an adventure in unlimited space. A bit of string affords a dimensional latitude that is unique among the entities. For an uncomplicated strand is a palpable object that, for all practical purposes, possesses one dimension only. If we move a single strand in a plane, interlacing it at will, actual objects of beauty and of utility can reulst in what is practically two dimensions; and if we choose to direct our strand out of this one plane, another dimension is added which provides opportunity for an excursion that is limited only by the scope of our own imagery and the lenght of the ropemaker&rsquo;s coil.</em></p>
<p><em>What can be more wonderful than that?</em></p>
<p><em>But there always seems to be another car ahead in every likely parking space. Here is a Mr. Klein who claims to have proved</em> (Mathematische Annalen) <em>that knots cannot exist in space of four dimensions. This in itself is bad enough, but if someonse else should come forward to prove that heaven does not exist in three dimensions, what future is there left for the confirmed knot tier?</em></p>

<h2 id="compactness">Compactness</h2>
<p>The last topological propery we&rsquo;ll study in this article is that of <strong>compact subspaces</strong>. This is an idea involving finitude. Take the plane $\ro$ as an example. Of course, both the open and closed intervals $(0,1)$ and $[0,1]$ are sets with ininitely many elements. We can consider the sequence $x_n=\frac{1}{n}$ in both of them, and, as we know, $x_n\rightarrow 0$ in the real line. However, inside $(0,1)$ the sequence $x_n$ is not convergent, as $0$ is not an element of this interval. The $x_n$ can, so to speak, stroll infinitely and avoid any convergence inside $(0,1),$ even if its distances are bounded. This can&rsquo;t happen in $[0,1]$&ndash; inside it, $x_n$ is forced to converge to an element in the interval. Remember too how the open interval is homeomohpric to $\ro^n.$ This all indicates that $(0,1)$ has some infinitude to it that $[0,1]$ doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Topologically, we can consider the situation as follows. Let&rsquo;s try to divide our space $X$ in many open subsets $\{U_i\}$ that cover it. We can subdivide $(0,1)$ into a chain of open sub-intervals that get smaller and smaller when getting to the endpoints. For example, inspired from the sequence $x_n$ above,</p>
$$(0,1)=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty (\frac{1}{n+1}, 1)$$<p>The particular &ldquo;infinitude&rdquo; of $(0,1)$ we discussed above is revealed in the fact that the open sets $\{(\frac{1}{n+1}, 1)\}$ cover the interval, and that&rsquo;s the best you can do with this decomposition: no finite subcollection of it would still cover the open interval, as there would always be some space left up. That is, there are decompositions of $(0,1)$ that <strong>require</strong> an infinite amount of sets to be a cover, and no finite sub-decomposition of them will cover the entire interval.</p>
<p>But in $[0,1]$ this can&rsquo;t happen. If we wanted to make the decomposition above cover $[0,1],$ we would have to add to it open (in $[0,1]$) sets of the form $[0,a)$ and $(b,1].$ But with these two new sets, $[0,1]$ can be finitely decomposed: for example, if $\frac{1}{N}< a,$ we get the finite open cover</p>
$$[0,1]=[0,a) \cup (\frac{1}{N},1)\cup (b,1]$$<p>The &ldquo;infinitude&rdquo; of $(0,1)$ is thus broken, and indeed $[0,1]$ has a certain finitude property called <strong>compactness</strong>, which guarantees that $[0,1]$ can be finitely decomposed, using <strong>any</strong> open decomposition of it.</p>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>That is, <strong>compactness is a measure of the finitude of the ways of decomposing a space</strong>.</p>
<p>Generally, this is the definition we get from the example above:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a topological space $X$ is called <strong>compact</strong> if for all open covers $\{U_i\}_{i\in J},$ there exists a finite subcollection $\{U_i\}_{i\leq n}$ that also covers $X.$</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t hard to prove that, if $X$ is compact and $f:X\rightarrow Y$ any continuous function, $f(X)$ is a compact subspace of $Y.$ In particular, homeomorphisms preserve compactness.</p>
<p>Example of compact spaces are $D^n,$ $S^n,$ $T^n,$ etc. Non-compact spaces include the reals $\ro^n$ and their open balls. You can imagine that the long line is very, very much non-compact.</p>
<p>Metric spaces have a particularly strong and useful description of compactness. Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space that is topologically compact. Take some sequence $\{x_n\}$ and let $S$ be the set of points of the sequence. The idea is that, because of the compactness of $X,$ $\{x_n\}$ is too restricted and must have limit points (if you need, recall the definition as given previosly). For if $S$ is infinite and has no limit points, then there must be a real $\epsilon>0$ such that the balls $B(x,\epsilon)$ intersect no point of $S$&ndash; or, if $x\in S,$ only $x$ itself. These form an open cover of $X,$ and, thus, there must be finitely many such balls covering $X$ as well. But, by their deffining property, this finite subcover contains only finitely many elements of $S$&ndash; and thus doesn&rsquo;t cover it at all, a contradiction.</p>
<p>If $S$ as above is finite, then, since $\{x_n\}$ is infinite, there must be a point hit by the sequence infinitely many times&ndash; which corresponds to a converging subsequence.</p>
<p>Thus we have proved:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: any sequence $\{x_n\}$ in a compact metric space $X$ has at least one converging subsequence.</p>
<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>This idea can be generalized to give the following definition:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: a topological space $X$ is <strong>sequentially compact</strong> it every sequence in it has at least one converging subsequence.</p>
<p>Naturally, one is lead to ask the relation between sequential and usual compactness. For metric spaces, <strong>they&rsquo;re equivalent</strong> (we proved one part above, <a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Sequentially_Compact_Metric_Space_is_Compact">here&rsquo;s the other half</a>), but for general topological spaces there&rsquo;s no actual general correspondence between any of the two. The long ray $[0,\infty)\times[0,1),$ for example, is sequentially compact, but not compact&ndash; and, in particular, the first <strong>non-metrizable</strong> space we met here.</p>
<p>Compact spaces were first studied in real analysis, specially because of their sequential properties. Here&rsquo;s a classic result (a subset $A$ of a metric space is said to be bounded if there&rsquo;s some real $M>0$ such that $d(x,y)< M$ for all $x,y\in A$):</p>
<p><strong>Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem</strong>: a subspace $A\subseteq \ro^n$ is compact if and only if $A$ is closed and bounded.</p>
<p>Further, compact spaces have some pretty strong properties. For example, every closed subspace of a compact space is compact as well. Homeomorphisms are also easier to prove, and a classical theorem states that every bijective continuous function from a compact space to a Hausdorff one must be a homeomorphism (<a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Continuous_Bijection_from_Compact_to_Hausdorff_is_Homeomorphism">proof</a>).</p>
<p>Another very strong theorem we&rsquo;ll later apply to cellular automata is Tychonoff&rsquo;s theorem. It isn&rsquo;t very hard to prove that finite products of compacts spaces are compact, but infinite products are considerably harder to deal with. Still, we have a positive answer:</p>
<p><strong>Tychonoff&rsquo;s theorem</strong>: any product of compact spaces is compact.</p>

<h3 id="conways-game-of-life">Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life</h3>
<p>Some readers might have heard of <strong>Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life</strong> (CGOL). It was invented by the mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John H. Conway</a>, who&ndash; due his abundant creativity and prolificity throughout his career&ndash; we will meet again later on in this series. This is a game played on an infinite square grid, which each cell in the grid having one of two states: dead (painted white) and alive (painted black). At each turn, states are updated according to the following rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Live cells survive only if they have 3 or 2 alive neighbors;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dead cells become alive if they have exactly 3 neighbors. Else, they stay dead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The fascinating thing about CGOL is that it allows for an extremely rich set of phenomena and interesting patterns. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Still life: patterns that never change, if not hit by something else;</li>
</ul>
<p>EXS</p>
<ul>
<li>Oscilators: patterns that keep repeating after some period;</li>
</ul>
<p>EXS</p>
<ul>
<li>Spaceships: patterns that repeat, but after displacing themselves in some direction, thus moving in the grid.</li>
</ul>
<p>EXS</p>
<p>CGOL has been an object of much research since it has been invented. By research, I do mean &ldquo;scientific&rdquo;, &ldquo;serious&rdquo; research by &ldquo;real&rdquo; mathematicians, but also by many other people who were enthralled by this cell-world, and who contributed to our understanding of it. Many people may contest CGOL&rsquo;s classification as a &ldquo;game&rdquo;, but I strongly disagree: it is a game of study, a botanical sort of game, a theory-building game collectively played. In that sense, it is an absolutely exceptional piece of rule/system-design. I can&rsquo;t refrain from being fascinated by all the</p>
<p>One of the reasons in particular I became so enamored with this world is due to the book <em>Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life&ndash; Mathematics and Construction</em>, by Nathaniel Johnson (<a href="https://njohnston.ca/">blog</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NathanielMath">Youtube channel</a>, <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Nathaniel_Johnston">LifeWiki page</a>) and Dave Greene (<a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Dave_Greene">LifeWiki page</a>). It&rsquo;s written like a textbook, with plenty of examples and exercises, so that you can actively participate in the &ldquo;research game&rdquo;. I read it shortly before taking (quite lately) my first physics course on college. Solving exercises from the course&rsquo;s textbook obviously reminded me of those I hade made before, those involving cells and their survival: the simple but descriptive worlds these two books described seemed so alike, both in truth and in dignity. Please do <a href="https://conwaylife.com/book/">check out the book</a> if you&rsquo;re interested, as it&rsquo;s available for free on the internet.</p>
<p>Many variants of CGOL have been derived, each with its own properties and particular phenomena. There are those with more intricate, &ldquo;fine-tuned&rdquo; rules, others with different notions of neighborhood, with more states etc. Some try to be more natural, some focus on artificial, circuit-like processes. Together, they form a part of the world of <strong>cellular automata</strong>. According to Wolfram MathWorld, we have</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: &ldquo;a cellular automaton (CA) is a collection of &lsquo;colored&rsquo; cells on a grid of specified shape that evolves through a number of discrete time steps according to a set of rules based on the states of neighboring cells&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The main part of this definition is that the evolution of a cell in our cell-world depends <strong>only</strong> on its neighbors. Note too that grid shapes can be basically arbitrary, but we&rsquo;ll mostly focus on the square 2D grid and the 1D grid with edges of the same length. We may also have different definitions of a &ldquo;neighborhood&rdquo;&ndash; the most common ones in the 2D square case being the Moore and von Neumann neighborhoods, as seen below.</p>
<p>IMG!!! NEIGHBORHOODS</p>
<p>More formally, a grid state is a function $s:G\rightarrow S,$ where $G$ is the set of our grid cells and $S$ that of possible cell states. In the 2D square grid, we have $G=\zo^2$; in the 1D one, $G=\zo.$ The set $S$ may be finite, infinite or even have continuously many states. A CA update rule is some function that brings state $s$ to $s',$ at each cell $c\in G,$ <strong>depending only on the neighbors of</strong> $c.$ We&rsquo;ll later on describe this function using topology.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s now define a topological space whose points represent configurations of a cellular automata. For simplicity, we&rsquo;ll use only 1D CAs, but doing so for any dimension is a simple extension and basically everything we say will remain valid. The only real restriction we impose is that we work with CAs of finite states (i.e., &ldquo;colors&rdquo;) over a lattice&ndash; thus no CAs on continuous space. Generalizations can be made, but we&rsquo;ll stick to this case here.</p>
<p>The formal definition of our space isn&rsquo;t actually hard from what we&rsquo;ve already seen, and further intuition will be given in the next section. If we have a (finite) set of cell states $\mathcal{A}$ (our <strong>alphabet</strong>), then $\az$ represents the set of configurations of cells, as seen above. All we do topologically is give $\mathcal{A}$ the discrete topology and $\az$ the product topology.</p>
<p>Open sets in $\az$ give us a notion of proximity, or of &ldquo;small perturbation&rdquo;, for cellular configurations. They can be easily and intuitively described. First, define a <strong>pattern</strong> as a <em>finite</em> set of positions and a specified assignment of states to each position&ndash; something like &ldquo;value $a_1$ in position $p_1$, &hellip;, value $a_n$ in position $p_n$&rdquo;. A configuration $x$ <strong>matches</strong> the pattern if in the specified positions it has the appropriate pattern values.</p>
<p>Then, by the definition of product topology, a set $U$ is open in $\az$ precisely when all its points satisfy at least one of some fixed patterns $p_1,...,p_n,$ in which case we say these patterns <strong>describe</strong> $U.$ Indeed, $U$ being open in the product topology means that it is a product of open sets in $\mathcal{A},$ with only finitely many non-trivial factors. Then $U$ is described by all the (still finitely many) possible patterns defined by all combinations of points coming from the non-trivial factors. Conversely, if $U$ is described by a pattern $p$ with specified values $p_i$ in the positions $i,$ $U$ is the product with only non-trivial factors being the one-point sets $\{p_i\}$ in the $i$-th coordinates&ndash; which, given the discrete topology on $\mathcal{A},$ are open, and thus $U$ itself is open.</p>
<p>The union of sets described by patterns represent configurations satisfying at least one of the patterns; the intersection forces matching both patterns.</p>
<p>A basis can thus be given by the sets</p>
$$B_p=\{x\in \az\mid x \text{ matches pattern } p\}$$<p>It isn&rsquo;t hard to see that the $B_p$ generate all open sets of $\az.$ To properly prove they&rsquo;re a basis, first note that the $B_p$ are open by the previous paragraphs. Then, the intersection $B_{p_1}\cap B_{p_2}$ is open by itself, containing configurations matching both $p_1$ and $p_2$ (when patterns disagree in some position, the intersection is $\emptyset,$ which is still open). The $B_p$ also cover $\az,$ thus being indeed a basis.</p>
<p>You can simplify even further and take as basis the $B_p,$ with $p$ a pattern on a single position.</p>
<p>Continuity is also simple to describe in our space. A function $f:\az\rightarrow \az$ being continuous means that, for each $U$ open, $\inv{f}(U)$ is open. Here, this fundamentally says that, if $U$ can be described by finitely many patterns $p_1,...,p_n$, then all the $y$ mapping to $f(y)$ in $U$ must also be described by patterns $p'_1,...,p'_m.$ This is the notion of &ldquo;continuity&rdquo; in our space, in the sense we gave above of a function $f$ being continuous whenever a small perturbation of $x$ leads to a small perturbation of $f(x)$.</p>
<p>With respect to topological properties, $\az$ is a Hausdorff spaces. For if $x$ and $y$ are distinct configurations, they must have different values $x_i$ and $y_i$ in some position $i.$ If $p_x$ is the pattern of having value $x_i$ in position $i$ and similarly for $p_y,$ then $p_x$ describes an open set $U_x$ and $p_y$ a $U_y.$ Then the set $U_x$ contains $x$ and $U_y$ contains $y,$ with $U_x\cap U_y=\emptyset$ since these are described by contradictory patterns. Thus $\az$ is Hausdorff.</p>
<p>Every point of $\az$ is its own connected component: for if distinct $x$ and $y$ were in the same component $C$, we could define $U_x$ and $U_y$ as above, so that $U_x\cap C$ and $U_y\cap C$ would divide the connected component. Spaces with this property are called <strong>totally disconnected</strong>, the discrete topology being always totally disconnected as well. The only paths in these spaces are constant paths $p(t)=x,$ for fixed $x.$ In particular, there&rsquo;s not much interesting to say about their homotopical properties.</p>
<p>Finally, since $\mathcal{A}$ with the discrete topology is finite and thus compact, $\az$ is compact by Tychonoff&rsquo;s theorem&ndash; a property that will later show itself as critical for the topological definition of CAs.</p>
<h3 id="intuition-fractals-arithmetic-and-limits-of-spaces">Intuition: fractals, arithmetic and limits of spaces</h3>
<p>I hope that the previous section was enough to give an intuition of proximity and continuity in our space $\az.$ But is there a way to properly visualize it, as we have been doing for most topological spaces&ndash; or is it too abstract for that? Turns out that you can, due to a classical construction by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor">Cantor</a>.</p>
<p>For simplicity, let&rsquo;s consider only binary cellular automata with only positive positions (if you wish, as a lattice in the left ray $[0,\infty)$). Our alphabet is just $\{0,1\},$ which is the set-theoretical definition of the number $2=\{0,1\}.$ Since we take only positive positions, instead of $2^\zo$ we use $\cantor$ and topologize it as defined in the previous section. Everything we said remains valid for $\cantor,$ and we&rsquo;ll use it just because it is a little more convenient to visualize.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how to see $\cantor$ inside the real line $\ro.$ Begin with the open interval $[0,1],$ and let $C_0=[0,1].$ Then divide it into three equal parts, and throw off the middle one, getting $C_1=[0,\frac{1}{3}]\cup [\frac{2}{3},1].$ Do this too on $C_1$ to get</p>
$$C_2=[0, \frac{1}{3^2}]\cup [\frac{2}{3^2}, \frac{1}{3}]\cup [\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3^2}]\cup[\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{3^2}, 1],$$<p>and then keep doing this, defining a $C_n$ for each step. You&rsquo;ll be able to see that each $C_n$ has the formula</p>
$$C_n=\bigcup^{3^{n-1}-1}_{k=0}\left([\frac{3k}{3^n}, \frac{3k+1}{3^n}]\cup [\frac{3k+2}{3^n}, \frac{3k+3}{3^n}]\right)$$<p>IMG!!!</p>
<p>Each $C_n$ should be seen as a representing a finite string of choices between going left or right. Elements of the first interval of $C_1$ have made the choiche &ldquo;left&rdquo;, and the others &ldquo;right&rdquo;; then, for $C_2,$ we have a further choice, and so on for all the $C_n.$ It seems like this has something to do with the CA configurations inside $\cantor.$ Formally, what we have is a map $f_n:C_n\rightarrow 2^n$ sending elements of each component of $C_n$ to the string of decisions made until now&ndash; $0$ being &ldquo;left&rdquo; and $1$ being &ldquo;right&rdquo;. $f_2:C_2\rightarrow 2^2$ sends, for example, $0$ to $00$ and $\frac{2}{3^2}$ is sent to $01,$ since it went left the first step and right the second. The $f_n$&rsquo;s are continuous when $2^n$ is given the discrete topology. Most importantly, they satisfy that, for $n>m,$ the first $m$ digits of $f_n(x)$ are exactly $f_m(x),$ for every $x.$</p>
<p>If we keep doing this forever, we get the infamous <strong>Cantor set</strong>:</p>
$$\mathcal{C}=\bigcap_{n=0}^\infty C_n$$<p>By the analogy above, elements of $\mathcal{C}$ should represent the infinite one-sided configurations inside $\cantor.$</p>
<p>This can relation can be formally estabilished using a relation to arithmetic. Indeed, instead of using base ten to write real numbers, we could just as well use base three (i.e., trinary form), in which we expand not by powers of $10$ but by those of $3.$ That is, we write every real $x$ as</p>
$$x=\sum_{-\infty}^n a_i\cdot 3^i,$$<p>in which case we write $x=a_na_{n-1}...a_0.a_{-1}a_{-2}..._3$. For example, $5=1\cdot 3 + 2\cdot 3^0,$ so that $5$ is written as $12_3$ in base three; a more intricate case is $\frac{1}{2},$ which is written as $0.111..._3.$</p>
<p>With trinary numbers, the Cantor set finds an easy description. Inside $[0,1],$ numbers in the first third of the interval have first fractional digit $0,$ those in the second $1$ and in the third $2$&ndash; just like, in decimal notation, numbers in the first tenth have first fractional digit $0$ and so on. What $C_1$ does is exclude those with $1$ as first digit after the comma. The $C_n$ do similarly for the $n$-th fractional digit, so that <strong>the Cantor set is the set of numbers in</strong> $[0,1]$ <strong>without any</strong> $1$<strong>&rsquo;s written in trinary.</strong></p>
<p>With this, can see points in $\mathcal{C}$ as finite one-sided strings of $0$&rsquo;s and $2$&rsquo;s (their fractional parts written in trinary form), and can define $f:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow \cantor$ by substituing $2$&rsquo;s with $1$&rsquo;s&ndash; e.g., the number $0.02202..._3$ is sent to the string $01101...$ inside $\cantor.$ Set-theoretically, $f$ is a bijection.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s introduce topology into the discussion by giving $\mathcal{C}$ the subspace topology. Is the $f$ above continuous? If so, is it a homeomorphism? The answers are both positive!</p>
<p>Indeed, consider some $C_n$ and an open interval $(a,b)$ containing only one of its connected components. Elements of $C_n\cap (a,b)$ are those which, in trinary form, until the $n$-th fractional digit correspond to the decisions representing $C_n.$ E.g., we can , and those will be all the elements of $[\frac{2}{3^2}, \frac{1}{3}]$ which in trinary begin as $0.01.$ These open intervals, intersected with the full Cantor set, form a basis of $\mathcal{C}.$ The function $f$ maps these bijectively to the the subsets of $\cantor$ that match some finite string of length $n$ at the left, which you can check form a basis for $\cantor.$ This leads to the conclusion that $f$ is a homeomorphism.</p>
<p>This could also be proven using general topological properties. In particular, it&rsquo;s easy to prove directly that $\mathcal{C}$ is Hausdorff; then the inverse $\inv{f}$ of $f$ is a continuous function from a compact to a Hausdorff space, which we saw previously is always a homeomorphism.</p>
<p>In particular, we have that $\cantor$ is a metric space, since it is homeomorphic to $\mathcal{C}$ and the latter can be given the standard Euclidean distance. A more intuitive metric can be given though. You can prove that in $\mathcal{C},$ the metric $d(x,y)=\frac{1}{k},$ where $k$ is the first fractional digit in which $x$ and $y$ differ, is a metric equivalent to the Euclidean one (inside of $\mathcal{C},$ of course). This metric tells you at which level $C_n$ the points start to diverge. Thus this $d$ and the Euclidean metric generate the same topology, and we can transport this to define a metric $d$ in $\cantor$&ndash; inducing the same topology we&rsquo;ve been using&ndash; defined simply as</p>
$$d(x,y)=\frac{1}{k}\text{, with } k \text{ the first number such that } x_k\neq y_k$$<p>We then define $d(x,x)=0$ in case the strings are equal. In the metric space $(\cantor, d),$ string which only start to be distinct in very advanced positions are seen as closer than those that right at the beginning diverge.</p>
<p>This can be generalized to $\az$ by using the metric</p>
$$d(x,y) =\frac{1}{k}\text{, with } k \text{ the first number such that } x_{[-k,k]}\neq y_{[-k,k]},$$<p>thus making $(\az, d)$ a metric space with the exact same topology given in the last section.</p>
<p>The reader might have noticed above that, since the components of $C_n$ are all partitioned in the same way to get $C_{n+1},$ then $\mathcal{C}$ (and thus $\cantor$) is a self-repeating space, a <strong>fractal</strong>. In terms of strings, this can be seen by noting that, in $\cantor,$ the subspaces $B_s$ of strings beginning with some string $s,$ for every finite $s,$ are all homeomorphic&ndash; so that $\cantor$ is composed of many equal, repeating subspaces. We often think of fractals in 2D, but the Cantor space is an examples of a one-dimensional fractal, and its iterative construction serves as a model to build many other fractals.</p>
<p>IMG!!! MANDELBROT SLA</p>
<p>An interesting and important application of the ideas above can be given to the area of number theory. In arithmetic, we constantly make use of the factorization of a number by primes. In that sense, there&rsquo;s something that unites numbers like $2,$ $4,$ $64,$ $256$ etc., as they&rsquo;re all powers of $2.$ For arithmetical purposes, they&rsquo;re actually quite close, despite the Euclidean distance. In some sense, the distance from $2^1=2$ to $2^4=16$ is just $3,$ since this is how many multiplications by a prime (here, $2$ itself) are needed to go from the first to the second.</p>
<p>This paves the way for the so-called &ldquo;p-adic integers&rdquo;. Writing integers $x\in\zo$ in basis $p,$</p>
$$x=\sum_{i=0}^n a_i\cdot p^i,$$<p>we define the <strong>p-adic distance</strong> $d(x,y)$ between $x$ and $y$ as $\frac{1}{k},$ where $k$ is the first digit such that the $p$-basis expansions of $x$ and $y$ differ. You can check that this indeed is a metric in $\zo.$ In it, for example, the sequence $x_n=p^n$ converges to $0,$ since $d(p^n,0)=\frac{1}{n}.$ For $p$-adic integers, what matters is the base $p$ expansion of a number (and thus its mod $p$ properties), not Euclidean distance.</p>
<p>You can see how this resembles what we did with the Cantor set, with the exception that numbers in $\zo$ have only a finite expansion in basis $p.$ But the p-adic distance allows us to actually overcome this.</p>
<p>Indeed, the sequence $x_n=1...1_p$ with $n$ many $1$&rsquo;s corresponds to the number $1 + p +...+p^n,$ so of course it diverges with the usual integer distance; but with $d$ as above, the distances get smaller and smaller: for $n>m,$ $d(x_n, x_m)=\frac{1}{m}.$ Still, in the set $\zo$ this $x_n$ doesn&rsquo;t converge&ndash; i.e., we have non-convergent Cauchy sequences, so that the metric space $(\zo, d)$ isn&rsquo;t complete.</p>
<p>We can formally complete $(\zo, d)$ by allowing for infinite strings in base $p,$ thus getting <strong>formal</strong> infinite series</p>
$$x=\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i\cdot p^i,$$<p>By &ldquo;formal&rdquo; we mean that these aren&rsquo;t integers, but formal expressions using integers and sums. Each of these series can be written as one-sided infinite strings $...a_2a_1a_0.$ They form a set called the <strong>p-adic integers</strong>, written as $\zo_p.$ You can make it a metric space using the p-adic distance as before, and it can be proven that $(\zo_p, d)$ is indeed complete.</p>
<p>In particular, we see directly from the set and metric definitions that the $2$-adic integers are homeomorphic to the Cantor set $\cantor$&ndash; and, of course, to its real version $\mathcal{C}.$ A direct homeomorphism $f:\zo_2\rightarrow \mathcal{C}$ can also be given by</p>
$$f(...a_2a_1a_0)=... + \frac{2a_2}{3^3}+\frac{2a_1}{3^2}+\frac{2a_0}{3}$$<p>IMG!!! P-ADIC DIST</p>
<p>Algebraically, $\zo_p$ can be given both sum and multiplication operations, but just formally summing and multiplying p-adic integers seen as infinite series. This makes $\zo_p$ a <strong>ring</strong>&ndash; for more, see the post on algebra. What&rsquo;s particularly interesting is that $\zo_p$ is algebraically richer than $\zo,$ allowing for some fractions and inverses. For example, you can check that, for $3$-adic integers, $...102102_3$ multiplied by $12_3$ (that is, $5$ in trinary) is equal to $1,$ and thus one might formally write something like $\frac{1}{5}=...102102_3$&ndash; thus one often hears that p-adic integers are numbers that can extend infinitely to the left. Not every normal integer has an inverse in $\zo_p,$ though&ndash; that is, the p-adic integers aren&rsquo;t a <strong>field</strong>.</p>
<p>Good to note that formally writing something like $\frac{1}{5}=...102102_3$ just indicates that there&rsquo;s an element of $\zo_3$ that, multiplied by $5=12_3,$ gives $1.$ Beyond that, this has nothing to do with the <em>rational</em> number $\frac{1}{5},$ and the p-adic numbers are to be seen as a number system on its own, distinct from $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\ro.$ For example, the number $x=...111_2$ in $\zo_2$ is such that $x+x=10_2\cdot x=...110_2$ (two times $x$), $x+x+x=11_2\cdot x=...1100_2$ (three times $x$) and so on, so that $n$ times $x$ is a sequence converging to $0$ as $n\rightarrow \infty.$ No such thing can exist in the real numbers.</p>
<p>Another equivalent way to define $\zo_p$ is by &ldquo;scanning&rdquo; the value of the series $\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i\cdot p^i$ up to the power $p^n$, for each $n.$ Let $\zmod{n}$ be the set of non-negative integers up to $n$, the integers mod $n$&ndash; for more structure on this set, see the post on algebra. Then every point of $\zo_p$ can be uniquely and exactly described by the infinite sequence of values</p>
$$(a_0p^0 \mmod p, a_0p^0 + a_1p^1 \mmod p^2, a_0p^0 + a_1p^1 + a_2p^2 \mmod p^3, ...),$$<p>i.e., by the partial values of the series up to powers $p^n.$ This is an element $(x_1\mmod p, x_2 \mmod p^2,...)$ of the product of sets $\zmod{p}\times \zmod {p^2}\times...$. If $X_n=\zmod{p}\times...\times\zmod{p^n},$ with the special property that $x_i = x_j \mmod p^j$ for every $i< j.$</p>
<p>This is similar to how, in $\cantor,$ as explained above, elements $x\in \cantor$ can be described by their slices $x_{[0,n]}$ until the $n$-th positions. Thus, $\cantor$ can be seen as those elements of the infinte product $2^1\times 2^2\times...$ such that each $n$-component is the string $x_{[0,n]},$ for some infinite binary string $x.$ That is, each factor represents scanning the infinite string up to the $n$-th position.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;scanning&rdquo; idea can be generalized as follows. Given a partially ordered indexing set $I$ (usually $\mathbb{N}$ or $\zo$), suppose you have a sequence of topological spaces $\{X_n\}_{n\in I}$ and continuous functions $f_{ij}: X_i\rightarrow X_j$ between them, for all natural pairs $i\geq j.$ Suppose further that $f_{ii}=\text{id}_{X_i}$ and that these functions compose in a transitive way: that is, $f_{ik}=f_{jk}\circ f_{ij}.$ Intuitively, each $X_i$ can be seen as a partial scan of some information up to size $i,$ and $f_{ij}$ tells you how to get a smaller slice of size $j$ of this information. This is called an <em>inverse system</em>. Then the <strong>inverse limit</strong> of the system, written $\varprojlim{X_n},$ is the space</p>
$$\varprojlim{X_n} = \left\{x\in \prod X_n\mid x_j=f_{ij}(x_i)\text{ for all }j\leq i\right\}$$<p>The topology given should be immediate&ndash; the subspace one inside the product topology of $\prod X_n.$</p>
<p>The space $\cantor$ can be given as an inverse limit by using the system $I=\mathbb{N},$ $X_n=2^1\times...\times 2^n$ with $f_{ij}(x)=x_{[0,j]}.$ The space $\zo_p$ can be see as an inverse limit by using the system $I=\mathbb{N},$ $X_n=\zmod{p}\times...\times \zmod{p^n}$ with $f_{ij}(x_1,...,x_i)=(x_1,...,x_j).$ Finally, $\az$ can be given as an inverse limit using the system $I=\zo,$ $X_n=\prod_{-\infty}^n\mathcal{A}$ and $f_{ij}(..., x_{i-1}, x_i)=(..., x_{j-1}, x_j).$</p>
<p>Inverse limits appear often as spaces representing infinite chains of choices&ndash; just like the Cantor set or the p-adic numbers. We&rsquo;ll possibly meet them and $\zo_p$ later on when we study tilings and repeating 2D patterns.</p>
<h2 id="the-topological-definition-of-cellular-automata">The topological definition of cellular automata</h2>
<p>Now that we hopefully have a solid understanding and intuition of $\az$ as topological spaces of cell configurations, let&rsquo;s see how CAs fit in this language. The end result of this sections isn&rsquo;t difficult to show with all we&rsquo;ve learned in this article, and, giving a topological characterization of cellular automata, represents the &ldquo;accumulation point&rdquo; of all we&rsquo;ve studied so far&ndash; but don&rsquo;t worry, much more will come, equally fascinating!</p>
<p>A cellular automata can be represented by a function $f:\az\rightarrow \az,$ sending every configuration to the updated configuration after one step of applying the CA&rsquo;s rule&ndash; we call it a <strong>transition function</strong> for some cellular automata. Naturally, we have to ask: is this function continuous? Taking a basis open set $B_p$ matching a pattern $p$ with a value $v$ on single position $i,$ the set $\inv{f}(B_p)$ is composed of all configurations $x$ such that $f(x)_i=v$&ndash; thus, since $f$ represents a CA, describable by pattern matching. Thus $\inv{f}(B_p)$ and, once these $B_p$ form a basis of $\az,$ $f$ is continuous.</p>
<p>Importantly, the value of $f(x)$ in some position $i$ depends only on the values around it, thus independing of $i$ itself. This symmetry is a very strong property, and can be more formally described using the <strong>shift symmetry</strong> of $\az.$ The function $s:\az\rightarrow\az$ defined by $s(x)_i=x_{i-1}$ is called the <em>left</em> shift and corresponds to pushing configurations one position to the left. It is an isommetry of $\az$ (consequently, a homeomorphism as well), something we can properly call a symmetry on the space of configurations. Its inverse $\inv{s}$ corresponds to a shift by one step to the right; $s^n$ (i.e., $s$ applied $n$ times) corresponds to $n$ steps to the left, and $s^{-n}$ to $n$ steps to the right.</p>
<p>The fact that the value of $f(x)$ in each position independs of the position properly can be formalized by the relation $f(s(x))=f(x),$ in which case $f$ is said to be <strong>shift-equivariant</strong> (we&rsquo;ll also use just &ldquo;equivariant&rdquo;). Thus, we&rsquo;ve proved that a CA transition function is continuous and equivariant. This is an interesting relation between cellular automata and topology, but more can be said: the following theorem stabilishes that having a continuous and equivariant transition function could actually be a <strong>definition for cellular automata.</strong> It is a cornerstone of the relation between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_dynamics">symbolic dynamics</a> and topology&ndash; and, consequently, between the digital arts and topology. It fits perfectly as a conclusion for this (admitedly, quite long) article; thank you for reading so far!</p>
<p><strong>Curtis-Hedlund-Lyndon Theorem</strong>: a function $f:\az\rightarrow \az$ is a cellular automata transition if and only if $f$ is continuous and equivariant.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>: We have already proved that, if $f$ represents a CA, it&rsquo;s continuous and equivariant; let&rsquo;s prove the other half. What we want is to prove that the value of $f(x)$ at each position is defined by a pattern around this same position, there being finitely many such updating patterns.</p>
<p>Thus, let $f$ be continuous and equivariant. Take some $x\in \az$ and consider the pattern with $f(x)_0$ in the $0$-th position. Configurations matching this pattern form an open set $V_x,$ and the set $U_x=\inv{f}(V_x)$ is open by hypothesis. Of course, $x\in U_x,$ for any $x,$ and thus these $\{U_x\}_{x\in \az}$ form an open cover of $\az.$ Since $\az$ is compact, there is a finite open subcover $\{U_{i}\}$ of $\az.$</p>
<p>In terms of patterns, these topological conclusions mean the following. Each $U_i$ can be described by patterns $p^i_1,...,p^i_m.$ Saying the $U_i$ cover $\az$ means that all configurations must match at least one of these $p^i_j,$ for some $i,j.$ The value of $f(x)$ in the center is defined by which of these patterns it matches, by definition of the $V_x$ and $U_x$ above.</p>
<p>This can be used to describe $f$ as a CA transition. Indeed, we just said that the value of $f(x)$ in position $0$ depends only on a pattern $p^i_j$ that $x$ matches. For any other position $i,$ we can consider the shift bringing position $i$ to the center, $s^{-i}(x).$ Since $f$ is equivariant, $f(x)=f(s^{-i}(x)),$ implying we can update at position $i$ as if it was in the center. Thus, the value of $f(x)$ at each position is defined by a pattern around this same position; since there are finitely many $p^i_j$&rsquo;s, we have proved what we wanted.</p>
